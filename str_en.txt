03035 NO! You're too late! I'm not the one that needed it!
03036 We were here to protest these goddamn things. Zombies... 'Infected People' some of us liked to call them... we were so stupid.
03037 There was a bunch of us at first. Then we lost Kass. It all went to shit after that.
03038 Every single one of them. Gone. I just watched Michelle turn an hour ago. She begged me to end things after.
03039 These things aren't people. They aren't monsters. They're the Devil himself, ripping us apart.
03040 And here we were. Protecting them the whole time, and how do they repay us?
03041 Eating us alive. Rotting us from the inside if we're unlucky enough to survive that long. Turning us into them.
03042 All these people. Dead. Yet here I am, one of the people who was here protesting the 'murder' of these 'people', still breathing. How is that fair?
03043 HOW IS ANY OF THIS FAIR?!?!?! Everybody's dead but me!
03044 Listen to me, right now! You didn't cause this outbreak. You're also not the only member of C.U.R.E. that's still alive, you know.

03905 Who's the girl?
03906 @Said her name was [00CC00FF,Allegra]. If I didn't let her in she woulda been zombie chow.
03907 And you cared?
03908 I already said those other guys weren't me. I'm opening up; take her wherever if you want to.
03909 Hey. Did this guy hurt you?
03910 @No, not at all. He's kinda scary, but I don't think these [00CC00FF,Pawn Shop Looters] are as bad as the rest of them. I had a run in with one.
03911 I think I'd like to get out of here, since he seems pretty keen on opening up. Do you know somewhere safe?
03912 @As a matter of fact, I do. I'll give you a hand back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
03913 Can I ask about the outfit?
03914 I'm here as a professional cosplayer. Do you recognize my outfit? I'm--

29024 The game starts with every player being dealt two cards face down.
29025 After the deal, there is a round of betting and three community cards are revealed.
29026 There is another round of betting and then another community card is flipped over.
29027 One more round of betting occurs and then the final card is revealed.
29028 After the final card is flipped over, there is a last round of betting.
29029 After the last round of betting, all the players remaining in the game reveal their hands. The player that reveals the best poker hand, using a combination of their two dealt cards and the five community cards, wins.
29030 KNOCKED OUT
29031 You don't need to play every hand. A big mistake for beginners is playing too many hands. For most players playing more hands means losing more hands, so fold your bad hands.
29032 CONGRATULATIONS, \0A YOU WON!!
29033 Pay attention to the other players at the table. This is a great way to read your opponent and try to figure out their tells. 
29035 If you have a great hand, raising your opponents is a good play. Raising will not only force players with a bad hand to fold but will also get more money into the pot.
29037 Good hands generally contain at least one of the following components:
29038 High Cards - Any ace or face card.
29039 Suited Cards - Cards that are the same suit.
29040 Connected - Two consecutive cards.

60320 O... kay? That's an interesting way to start a conversation. What's up, Vikki?
60321 @I've been thinking a lot about what happened. I know it's a really weird request, but is there any way you could get me the [00CC00FF,Glass Shard] that protestor guy was using?
60322 ...You mean the glass he used to almost kill you?
60323 I know! I said it was weird! I promise I'm not going to do anything weird or dangerous with it. I'm honestly am just really interested in the minds killers and psychopaths.
60324 I can't fully explain the reason I want it. I don't even know fully why I do. I just, like... need it to cope, or something. I definitely need therapy.

60334 Oh, no you don't, Frank! Don't even think about trying to talk me down!
60335 Kindell, I know what I said, but please-
60336 Nope! I'm not hearing it, Frank. I'm going out there regardless of what you say. I've got a crew assembled. You have some people with real combat experience this time.
60337 Those people have never dealt with something like this. There is experimental gas out there making the zombies go berserk.
60338 I know! I saw the military get ripped apart on the cameras. I don't care! We're just a boxed up lunch for the zombies right now. The longer we wait, the more that will mutate.
60339 I hear you, Kindell. You're not wrong - the longer this goes on, the more of them there are gonna be.
60340 So get out of my way.
60341 Hold on, Kindell. I know you're ready to go out there this second, but can you at least hear me out? I'm going to look into the gas. Maybe I can turn it off.
60342 So you can go out there, but not me? Nobody else has the 'Frank West' privilege around here, is that it?!
60343 Can you wait a couple of hours, at least? I'm going to look into it right now. Don't risk everyone's life like that without exploring all your options.
60344 Argh... fine. You owe me, Frank. You already lied to me once about coming here. Don't worry, I have something in mind.
60345 Oh boy.
60346 @Gimme some of that cash you've been picking up around the city.
60347 Are you serious?
60348 What? You told me I'd be able to come and go from here as I please. That was a lie, clearly, so the least you could do is share what you've found out there.
60349 @[00CC00FF,$250,000] shouldn't be hard to come by in a city like this...

60375 Popcorn? Is this dill pickle? This was Tim's favorite! Oh, he'd be laughing so hard if he knew I had to eat this...
60376 I'll suffer through it, though. For Tim. I guess I need to give him a good laugh sometimes while he's looking down on me.
60377 I thought this might cheer you up a little bit. Have some popcorn for Tim. I think there's some seasoning with it.

65076 Oh, I'm awful. This is so horrible! 
65077 I know this zombie outbreak is --
65078 I'm starving! I've been all through the Palisades already! It's cleaned out! I HAVE TO EAT when I'm stressed!
65079 @I might have something here for you... and the [00CC00FF,Safe House] has some food. We should go there. It's safe.
65080 No, no! I've got to have something else! And soon! I won't have the energy to go far until I eat! I found some other stuff, but who cares if it's not food! 
65081 Did you find anything yummy?
65083 This looks delicious!
65084 @I can see two construction workers trapped at the [00CC00FF,worksite] in the [00CC00FF,South Plaza]. It doesn't look good, you better hurry.
65086 Lady! If you come with me, I can take you to a safe place. 
65087 I can take care of myself for now, but my friend sure can't. She fights like a blind mouse. I ain't leaving her!
65088 Thanks for saving my pal. I thought I'd hammered my last nail, if you know what I'm saying.
65089 No problem. Let's just get out of here. I know a safe place.
65090 You got it, mister! Let's get out of here. 
65091 Lady? You okay? 
65092 I'm not used to zombies, I tell you what. I'm real tired from fighting.
65093 Come on. There's a safe place, not too far from here. Follow me.
65095 Help! 
65096 Hey man, this place has gone CRAZY. I just finished cashing out all my winnings, I come out, and all this crap is goin' on. Can't even spend my new cash. What the hell?
65097 @Spending the cash is the least of your worries. Listen, I can bring you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House] where there aren't any zombies to worry about.
65098 Okay, man. I just wanna get my new retirement fund to safety. And hopefully not wreck this new suit.
65099 @Whoa, pal. No [00CC00FF,gun]? I'm all for a safe place to ride this out, but this cash can't walk around unprotected. Look, get a [00CC00FF,gun] and then we'll take off. I'll even pay you.
65100 My man has a gun! Me and my cash need some protection. I hope you know how to use that thing?
65101 Just point and shoot, pal. Works every time.
65102 Love the enthusiasm. Get me to safety, and your bank account will thank me.
65103 @I see a man hiding on top of the [00CC00FF,Hamburger Fiefdom] in the food court. He looks like he's waiting for someone.
65104 Hey, didn't think you saw me up here. The name's Jasper. I'm fine, but...
65105 Me'n Cinda, one of the other barkeeps, were working the Shoal Nightclub when this zombie mess happened.  She's a huge fan of yours.
65106 We found this safe spot here but we started running low on supplies.
65107 Thank you... I thought I was a goner...
65108 Whoa! Wait a second... You're Frank West!  I'm a huge fan!
65109 Thanks lady.  Always a pleasure to meet a fan, but we should get you to safety.
65110 @Wait, we can't go yet.  My friend [00CC00FF,Jasper] is fan of yours too.  You have to save him.
65111 @I'm safe for now, so I'm not moving until [00CC00FF,Jasper] gets here.  Please find him.
65112 I know!  I can't wait to tell all our friends that Frank West was the one who saved us!
65113 Will you please come with me now? I can get us through all these zombies.
65114 I found your friend, Jasper.
65115 @Frank... Looks like there are some survivors holed up in the men's restroom in the [00CC00FF,Americana Casino]. Check it out! I think I saw someone from CURE!
65116 I know they said that, but I don't think he's a terrorist. He risked his life to save me.
65117 Come on, Cinda. Frank West can take us someplace safe, he's a pro!
65118 Cinda! You're safe! I was so worried about you! 
65119 @Hey Frank, looks like someone's vandalizing slots in the [00CC00FF,Americana]! You better get over there.
65120 Stuart, there's someone here! He's alive!
65121 What if he's from the company? He might report us! 
65122 Stay out of our business, buddy! I'm just taking my worker's comp! They left us with nothing!
65123 We've got to get out of here! Stuart's not a bad guy. Please stop him before he gets hurt. 
65124 Sorry. We just thought we were getting what we were owed. We used to work here, until...
65125 I don't care what you were doing, but we have to get to safety.
65126 I better go with you before those things get us too. We're probably in trouble by now anyway.
65127 Buddy, can't you give a guy a break? Okay, you win. I was just trying to get paid my due. 
65128 @Sorry, but you don't have to do this. Come on, I can take you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65129 Fine, let's get outta here. The casinos are insured against this, but I probably won't get my job back.
65130 @Frank, there's someone fighting off zombies at the [00CC00FF,SporTrance] in the [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza]. You'd better check it out.
65131 These zombies are all over me! I just need some room to breathe!
65132 Thanks. I was getting mauled over here. I lost my good club... but good thing I got a strong swing and my old nine-iron! 
65133 No problem, but listen, it isn't safe out here.
65134 @If you follow me, I can take you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65135 I'm used to crowds on the Pro Tour, but the fans aren't usually this aggressive. Let's go! 
65136 On the plus side, all this swinging is good for my form. I just hope my old club can handle the extra punishment.
65137 No way, man. The only way to get this case is to take it from my cold, dead hand.
65138 Looking to make some extra cash? 
65139 Help out a friend, man! I need some protection!
65149 @I saw a postal cart driving around [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza]. Check it out, there might be [00CC00FF,Zombrex ]in one of those packages.
65162 Anything that gets me out of here is fine by me.

65202 @Frank, there's someone at the edge of the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Hotel roof]! She's got a gun!
65203 *Sob* Oh mom, I'm sorry I left you.
65204 I should have stayed with her... *sniff*
65205 Hey, lady. Don't shoot me! Listen, I can help you!
65206 We couldn't decide on a safe place, so we ended up arguing, and she stormed off. If anything happened to her ....
65207 Hey, she might be just fine. Did you see where she went?
65208 @She was talking about the [00CC00FF,Food Court ]when she left. She couldn't have made it very far...
65209 Alright. Stay here and take your finger off the trigger. If she's alive, I'll find her.
65210 I guess I've got nothing else to lose... I'll wait a little while longer.
65211 @...She said she was headed to the [00CC00FF,Food Court].
65212 Oh, I'm so glad you're back! Did you find my mother?
65213 Yeah ... I'm really sorry, but ... she didn't make it.
65214 No! Oh, Mom! I knew I should have stayed with her ... what have I done?!
65215 There's nothing left for me now... Oh, Mom! I'm coming! I'll never leave you again...
65216 No! Wait!
65217 Oh my god you are alive!! Thank god you found me. I had an argument with my daughter and...
65218 Actually, I saw your daughter on the hotel rooftop and she's got a gun. I'm worried she might...do something. But I can take you there.
65219 A gun? She was always such a tomboy! Never did play with dolls. Please, take me to her!
65220 Lillian? You put that gun down this instant! 
65221 ... ... Mom? ... MOM!
65222 Oh Lillian, I'm so glad you're safe!
65223 Thank you. Thank you so much for saving my mom.
65224 @You're welcome, but we're not done yet. We've got to get back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65226 @There are three women in the [00CC00FF,pool] at the [00CC00FF,Palisades Mall]. But Frank just, uh, keep your head in this one, okay?
65229 Honey, don't mind if I'm a little forward, but are you single?
65232 We'd like to sugar, but we aren't just any girls.
65233 Excuse me?
65234 @[00CC00FF,$10,000] and we're all yours. We won't move for a dime less. Baby, you know you want to. 
65235 I'm so sorry, Frank. 
65236 @[00CC00FF,$10,000], and trust me, you won't be disappointed.
65237 Thanks, baby! We're worth every penny.
65238 Sorry, baby. I won't go anywhere without the boss-lady's say so.
65239 Sorry, hun, but it's all of us or none of us unlesss the boss says otherwise. But you won't be sorry, sugar. Talk to the boss-lady to make a deal.
65240 Honey, would you be a dear and help us carry our things?
65241 Seriously?! You ladies are shopping? But there are zombies everywhere!
65242 Zombies or no zombies, Kathy's Space was having a sale, and it will take more than the undead to stop me. I just bought the cutest new pumps.
65243 Listen, you might find bargains, but it just isn't safe out here. Follow me and I'll get you to a safe place.
65244 Sure, but can you carry our boxes? We paid good money for all these new things and we're not leaving them all here! 
65247 Finally, someone who can help us.
65249 When the outbreak happened, we figured there wouldn't be any lineups at the mall, so we went shopping.
65250 Shopping with zombies?
65251 Oh these zombies aren't too bad. We've seen worse crowds on Black Friday. 
65252 Well, that aside. Follow me to safety. I'll protect you.
65253 Just carry our bags, and we'll protect you. We're not exactly the damsel-in-distress type. You'll see. 
65254 Thank you, handsome. I got such a good price on those shoes there was NO WAY I was leaving them here. 
65255 @We all got our own priorities. You can follow me to the [00CC00FF,Safe House] now. 
65256 Thanks yet again, but I have one other favor to ask?
65257 What is it?
65258 We need a big, strong man to carry our boxes. Would you fetch them from the counter? And you better not break anything. I've got fine crystal in there.
65259 You clumsy oaf!
65261 You violent jerk!
65263 I can't believe it. How could you do that?!
65265 @Uh, Frank... there seems to be a dancer throwing up in the [00CC00FF,Americana Casino].
65266 Wow... Lady, you alright?
65267 Hey! There you are... wait... you're not Josh. Where'd he run off to?
65268 Josh?
65269 Yeah. He was in that nice little bachelor party that kept buying me drinks. *hic* Man, something smells like it died out here...
65270 A lot of things died out there. Listen lady, there are zombies everywhere. We've got to go. 
65271 Oh yeah *hic*, there's that Terror is Reality show in town tomorrow... That T.K. is so hot... *hic*
65272 That was yesterday. There's been an outbreak. And I think you need some help.
65273 Wait *hic*, yesterday? Last thing I remember was Josh and those boys buying me drinks. I must'a passed out. *hic*
65274 @Well, you should come with me. It isn't safe out here and I can take you where you can lie down or get something to drink. There's a [00CC00FF,Safe House]...
65275 *hic* Sounds kinda fun, baby... Let's party!
65276 Wait, no... that's not what I meant... Nevermind... let's just get out of here.
65277 I'll find out what's going on.
65279 Are you guys okay?
65280 Yeah. We took some hits, and we are the only ones left from the squad.
65281 Thanks for helping us out.
65282 Talk to the Sarge.  He makes all the decisions. 
65283 Suck it up, soldier! We need to get to the bottom of this.
65286 Sergeant Michael Woo, at your service.  Half of our unit's been wiped out. Me n' Kuss over there are all that's left.
65287 We intended to follow look for survivors, but Private Kuss over here got hurt.  Any other survivors around?
65288 @Sorry pal. Not much alive left, but there are other survivors at the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
65289 We'll be more good there than anywhere else. You give Kuss a hand and lead the way; I'll cover your back.
65290 Sarge!  I got survivors coming out of the tunnel.
65291 @Frank, there's someone trying to get into an ATM machine in the [00CC00FF,Shamrock Casino]. I think he's trying to rob it.
65292 Hey buddy. What the hell do you think you're doing? 
65294 I am Woodrow Rutherford. CEO and owner of one of the largest banks in the state.
65296 Prudency, young man! In just over 1 day's time the military will rescue us from all this perfectly good money!
65297 We can't let the cash in these ATM's go to waste! 
65298 So you're going to pocket it before anything happens?
65299 Well, no one else is!! And the yacht is a bit small. I could really use another boat - er...
65302 @Money's gonna be the least of your problems if a zombie gets you. Let me take you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65303 I will not let all this money go for nothing. That would be letting the zombies win.
65304 Alright, son. You keep those SOB's off me.
65307 These dang zombies are nothing but trouble.
65308 This is the last one. We're almost done, partner.
65309 This one's done. Let's make our way to the next one.
65311 Hurry, son. Time's a wastin'. We must fulfill our duties!
65312 Only one more to go.
65313 Alright, that's the last of 'em. You did the right thing, son. By me. *heh heh heh*
65314 @Thank you, son. This money will go to good use, that I can assure you *heh, heh, heh*. Now let's get movin' to that [00CC00FF,Safe House] already.
65315 @Frank, I think I can see someone hiding by the elevators in the [00CC00FF,Hotel]. She looks cold.
65316 Are you okay?
65317 OH MY GOD! LIKE, DON'T LOOK AT ME!
65318 Sorry... I'm just trying to help.
65319 Oh my god. This is like, totally embarrassing. This is like, a total tragedy!
65320 What happened?
65321 Like, I was in my hotel room, I went to get some ice, and the stupid door locked behind me. I came down, and this place was totally zombified. Like, seriously!
65322 A zombie outbreak started. But come with me. I can get you to safety.
65323 Are you like drunk or some junk? I can't go out there like this.
65324 What are you talking about? You can't stay here.
65325 Look, what if a cute guy, or like a hunky prize fighter or a hot movie star or something sees me? I would like totally die!
65326 Son, I worked hard for this money. I'm not giving it up that easily.
65327 @Whatever, okay? Maybe if I wasn't like the only one doing it. I'll tell you what, I'll totally go with you IF you are wearing just your[00CC00FF, underwear] too.
65328 @Those clothes are like no way as embarrassing. Down to your[00CC00FF, underwear], dude! Check that [00CC00FF,men's store by the statue.]
65329 That's hot!
65330 Yeah, I sure feel... hot. Look, let's just get going.
65331 For sure. For like sharing in my embarrassment, I'll like totally be your BFF.
65332 Yes! That's a +27 critical attack! Take THAT, foul knave!
65333 Don't forget to check his pouches for treasure. *snort*
65334 Indeed, you have a 95% chance of getting an item, and a 24.7% chance of getting a rare weapon.
65335 Uh, I think it's against the rules for the Game Overlord to give percentages like that...
65336 Look, I'm the Game Overlord, I get to make the rules.
65337 Your Exploding Fire spell went off prematurely. You now have 3rd degree burns on your hands.
65338 By the Hammer of Voltainus, I SMITE THEE! *snort*
65339 If only my charisma were this high in real life...
65340 Gosh, sir. You scared the beejesus outta me. *snort* I'm Curtis. Curtis Ellenton.
65341 What are you guys doing in here?
65342 When the zombies came out, we built ourselves a fort to stay safe.
65343 You must be strong to have gotten this far. Voltainus must shine his light upon you. *snort*
65344 So, who built the barricade?
65345 I am the master foreman! You may call me Brian. I call this place the Freedom Spire!
65346 You guys have been here since the zombies got loose?
65347 Well, that isn't entirely accurate. We came to meet girls, but none of us can talk to any...
65348 So you guys have been hiding here this entire time?
65349 Yes, this is the only refuge for our kind.
65350 We get ridiculed for our sense of fashion, but with our combined mental strength, we will soon rule all!
65351 01101000 01101001
65352 That's "hi" in binary.
65353 Uh... Hi.
65354 There was a 21.862% chance that someone would find us before the military came. We decided to take our chances and wait here.
65355 We came here because we thought it would be easy to meet girls, but we all froze up.
65356 That's rough.
65357 I know! All the ads about this place were such a lie. Since we've been here, we haven't seen a single girl go wild!
65358 Look, girl troubles aside, you can't stay here. It isn't safe.
65359 We've been safe so far. We'll stay here.
65360 @Just come along with me to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. Maybe one of the girls can help you with...
65361 @There are girls there? Inside a high security [00CC00FF,Safe House] with no escape? What are we waiting for? Take us to live girls, good sir!
65362 @I see two guys in [00CC00FF,From Fortune With Love ]at the [00CC00FF,Theme Park]. I'm not sure if they're laughing or fighting. 
65363 No way are you funnier. I've been telling jokes since you were in diapers.
65364 Yeah, I can tell. Your material is so old it's in Sanskrit.
65365 Uh... Hello?
65366 Whoa, a living person!
65367 Yeah, he must not have heard your set... Maybe he can settle this?
65368 What's going on?
65369 We were here for the Fortune City Comedy Festival. Both of us were up for the Comedian of the year, but the zombies attacked before we could find out who won.
65370 Yeah, help us out here. Listen to both of our jokes, and then give that award on the table to the one you think is funniest.
65371 What does a vegan zombie eat?
65372 What do sloppy zombies get on their clothes when they eat?
65373 YES! I would like to thank the Academy and all the little people I had to stomp to get here. I kid, I kid.
65374 BOO YAH! You can go cry to your wife about this. Oh, and tell her I said thanks for the incredible evening. 
65375 @Hey Frank, come back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. [00CC00FF,Europa] wants to talk to you. She's in the lounge.
65376 Oh. My. God. Between the zombies and the military there's like a terrible danger! 
65377 Um, yeah. I know. Lots of people are - 
65378 People? Who said anything about people? We have to like save the Fortunea Aspidistra!
65379 The what?
65380 Fortunea Aspidistra. It's a small plant that only grows on the Fortune City butte. Don't you know anything?
65381 @You are like the only one who can save it! I know a local artist that used it in his pieces. I'm sure it's at the [00CC00FF,Cleroux Collection] in the [00CC00FF,Palisades Mall.]
65382 I came here to get it and plant it to make sure that this like wonderful piece of flora lives on.
65383 I'm not sure if I would risk my life for a plant...
65384 I saw it in your eyes when you like saved me... You wouldn't risk our whole ecosystem! Pretty please?
65385 @Remember, it's a green plant used in [00CC00FF,Peace Art]. I saw some in the [00CC00FF,Cleroux Collection.]
65386 Like thank you so much. Mother Earth has a true Champion in the famous reporter Frank West.
65387 Thanks again, sugar pants. 
65388 Just listen to the material and give the trophy over there to the funnier one.
65389 Hurry up, son. Time's a wastin'.
65390 If you want to help, follow me, and keep those zombies off my back!
65391 *sniff* Why didn't I listen to her ...?
65392 Hey! You should like do a report on the stuff that's going on here.  It's like news!
65393 That's bunk... I guess old guys think old jokes are funny.
65394 You just had to encourage him, didn't ya?

65687 You can gamble some other day when this is all blown over. Let's get somewhere safe.
65688 @You can run along to your Safe House if you like. I'm down [00CC00FF,$20,000] and I'm not going anywhere until I have made that money back. 
65689 Why not make yourself useful and play those other slots for me?
65690 @I'm not going anywhere until I get my [00CC00FF,$20,000] back. I came to Fortune City to win money. I ain't gonna lose it. 
65691 @You're so generous. How about another [00CC00FF,$5000]?
65692 Oy, wanker! Get off the stage! We got a show on, love!
65693 Lady, that crowd is a bunch of zombies trying to get up here to eat you! 
65694 Zombie wankers, eh? I thought these blokes were just head bangin' to the best damn Angel Lust concert ever!
65695 The outbreak must have happened during your show. Listen, we need to get to safety.
65696 Alright, mate. We'll go along with you, but we're artists - we'll have to finish up first. 
65697 Let's crank it, boys! We're gonna blow their minds! 
65698 Look 'ere, mate. Autographs are after the show.
65699 I'm not here for an autograph. That audience is actually a hungry zombie horde. 
65700 Get off the stage, wanker! Just a bit of a rough crowd, is all. 
65701 Take a closer look.
65702 Blimey, he's right. Well, we might as well finish this set. With a bang. 
65703 A little advice for you, there're some pretty greedy folk in Fortune City.  Might do you well to keep some cash handy.
65705 You one of those wankers who don't know good thrash metal when it kicks you in the nuts? I can take care o' that for ya! Get back in the crowd! 
65706 Crowd? Those are zombies! We've got to get you somewhere safe. 
65707 Bullocks, mate! They're just mad for Angel Lust is all. Can ya blame 'em? We RAWK. Don't get your knickers in a tizzy.
65708 No buddy, those are REAL zombies.
65709 Well, ain't that something. You're right, mate. Playin' for the dead - what more could a metal band want?!

65726 I totally heard from a friend ... well, more like a friend's friend ... I wouldn't say she's my friend, since she totally tried to steal my boyfriend ...
65727 @Anyway, she like told me there's a [00CC00FF,men's store at the other side of the mall.] It's by that like totally cruel statue of the dude killing a lion. You could like, check there.
65728 This is your LAST warning. If you have any guns on hand, we will shoot.
65729 Hey buddy, can you help us out here?
65730 Yeah, just follow me. I can get us to safety.
65731 Hold your horses there, sport. You have to settle an argument first.
65732 You gotta be kidding...
65733 Normally, I make a living doing just that, but I'm serious.
65734 Me and my... "friend" here are in town for the Fortune City Comedy Festival.
65735 @Hmmm... That looks like an [00CC00FF,underwear] display.
65736 C'mon, let's like go already.
65737 Umm... I'm like... really scared, actually. Will you hold my hand?
65742 @That was great! You said you know where there's more food? A [00CC00FF,Safe House]? Yummy! Let's go! Maybe there I could show you the other stuff I found!
65744 Listen, why the hell would I go around helping people like you if my real goal was to kill everyone? Why would I stick around?
65745 W-We aren't sending her to her death! W-We just aren't safe with her here...
65746 They pinned it on me because I was there. But I know what it's like to lose someone in a zombie outbreak. I'd never wish that on anyone. 
65747 I... guess I never really considered it like that. 
65748 This isn't my first rodeo, Stuart. I have a little experience with this kind of thing. Just give me some time.
65749 Fine, Frank. But if anything happens, it's on you.
65750 A prestigious road is ahead of you, travel and be rewarded along the way.
65751 Felines love the taste of meat, make sure it's not you they eat!
65752 Playing in the sand can unearth wonderful treasures!
65753 Your prestige is growing, I see good things ahead of you.
65754 The people you help in life can help you in return. Simply ask them.
65755 In dark times a bright heart is required. Heroes show the way.
65756 Always borrow money from a pessimist. He won't expect it back.
65757 You are prestigious in your actions, great and small.
65758 Not everyone you meet can be trusted. Safety is an illusion.
65759 Certain items are expensive for a very good reason; discover why!
65760 I have seen your prestige grow greater by the hour. Continue and be rewarded!
65761 Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.
65762 A dedicated person should be rewarded for their efforts.
65763 Those who travel too far need to go back, to another point. 
65764 Further fortunes can only be given to those less fortunate.
65765 You can't be serious.
65766 Thanks, friend. I knew I liked you the moment I saw you.
65767 @Another [00CC00FF,$5000 ]is all it'll take for this trip to feel worthwhile. 
65768 Hey, pal. Can I help out?
65769 Only if you can teleport me right out of this town, but I don't think you can do that.
65770  I just can't take it anymore. I might ... I might have to end it all.
65771 Hey, I know it's rough out here, but if you follow me I can take you somewhere safe.
65772 "Safe", huh? Now, that's funny. What is "safe", really, in this world?
65773 If we were locked deep underground in a bomb shelter, maybe my body would be safe. But how about my mind?
65774 Huh? I'm talking about a Safe House, a bunker. There are no zombies there.
65775 That's where you're wrong. The zombies are in my head now. I can't unsee the things I've seen.
65776 We've all seen a lot of terrible things. But we've got a chance at a future. Let's get out of here. 
65777 But we'll have to go through THEM to get there.
65778  And that means more killing. So much killing.
65779  And it's horrible. But it's what we have to do to survive.
65780 Maybe I don't want to survive if that's what surviving means. I'm sick of the carnage.
65781 So much fighting .... so much blood.
65783 ...
65785 But they're not alive anymore.
65786 But they used to be. Not that long ago. And look at them, they're something, right? They move, they eat. And man, do they ever bleed.
65787 They can't feel anything. They're just hungry mouths now.
65788 But they're dead now, buddy. And your mother probably gives a shit whether you survive or not.
65789 I wouldn't count on it. She never liked me when I got down.
65790 We did it.
65807 You're right, I can't.
65808 Who knows, maybe I've been looking for the easy out all along.
65809 *Sigh* You know, this is a fascinating conversation. How about we continue it back at the Safe House?
65810 We think they want to eat us, but do we really KNOW that?! Maybe they somehow just want to get close to us ... and then we ... we kill them.
65811 Put it this way, pal. They want to eat you. And then you die.
65812 See, that's just what I'm saying. Maybe it's just a matter of time ... or maybe I'm already dead. On the inside.
65813 I have this feeling that if you got down from here and maybe chilled out for a while in a quiet place, you'd feel a lot better.
65814 It's so tempting ... to just end it all right now.
65815 Okay, that's enough. It's time to get the hell out of there. I can't stand listening to you any longer. Come on!
65816 Wow, tough love. Isn't that what they call it? You must sense a spark of life still within! I think I'm sick of listening to me, too! Let's go! 
65817 Yoo hoo, handsome! Can you help a girl out?
65818 Over here! I'm stuck! 
65819 Excuse me, mer-lady, but are you alright?
65820 Not really. I can't move around in this costume and ... well, zombies.
65821 @Can't you just take it off? Then you can follow me to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65822 But I can't walk in this thing!
65823 Can't you just take it off if it's a costume?
65824 Well ... I forgot my bathing suit at home so ... kind of going commando here.
65825 Really!? I mean ... I guess I can carry you.
65826 I can't take this off, okay? I just met you. I'm not that kind of mermaid. Please help me!! Can you pick me up?
65827 Great. Alright, I can carry you back there.
65828 Oh, thank you so much! My name is Tammy.
65829 @Frank, there's a woman lying on the floor of the [00CC00FF,Venus Touch Spa ]in the [00CC00FF,Palisades]. It looks like she's barely alive. 
65830 Lady? I can help you. 
65831 Please, please help me. I was stuck in that tanning bed. The staff ran away or something. I'm so parched. I can barely move.
65832 I'll say. You're baked. Literally. 
65833 It gets worse... I was lying on my front for way too long. This can't be good for my tan lines. I'm so thirsty. What's going on out here?
65834 You didn't know about the zombie outbreak? Listen, I can take you somewhere safe.
65835 I'm still very weak.
65836 @Zombie outbreak?! I just thought the service here was really bad. But I can hardly move. I need something to [00CC00FF,drink].
65837 Dammit, Trixie-Lynn! Why dint you brang that fire 'stinguisher in here!? 
65838 HANG ON!
65839 HURRY! PLEASE! It's hotter'n hell's basement in 'ere!
65840 Whew. Thank ya kindly, pard'ner.
65841 What happened in here?
65842 Me an' the wife, Trixie-Lynn, we tried to keep them zombies away.
65843 We dun figured that they didn't like fire all too much, so we would build a door made outta fire to keep 'em out.
65844 Didn't really figure too much on how a fire door wouldn't open to let us out.
65845 But thanks all the same. From now on, you're as good as kin in Elrod's book.
65846 Thanks fer puttin out the fire, hun.
65847 No problem. Let's get outta here.
65848 Whoa, what's your hurry? You may have put one fire out, but a handsome man like yourself seems to have lit another one under lil' ol' me.
65849 ...
65850 You've got real purdy eyes. *giggle*
65851 Frank nice. That kitty scared Lenny real bad. 
65852 Kitty can't hurt you now, okay? You're safe, Lenny. 
65853 Frank stopped the kitty from eating Lenny, so Lenny can keep counting. Frank keeps it. 
65854 Charlie put the money away, safe, safe, nice and safe. So nice people can get it later. 
65855 What's that, Lenny?
65856 Lenny's a good driver. Lenny likes numbers, too. Lenny likes counting. 
65857 Numbers are good times, Lenny. 
65858 @Charlie kept some big numbers in the [00CC00FF,Yucatan casino]. So Lenny can count. Charlie good at slots. 
65859 Lenny keeps key safe so Charlie can give Lenny money later. To count. Frank kept the kitty away. 
65860 Secret key?
65861 Frank so nice to Lenny. Maybe Frank wants secret key. To get numbers! 
65862 Hmmm...
65863 Now, what were those numbers again? 0-7-1-2-1-9-8-1
65864 Security clearance accepted.
65865 Hey Lenny, I found Charlie's money.
65866 Frank smart! Like with kitty! Frank can keep it. 
65867 The only way out is the easy way out.
65868 What? Lenny, are you sure? It's yours, and you can have it.
65869 @So many numbers to count. Frank likes numbers, too! All in the [00CC00FF,Yucatan]. 
65870 It was my best piece. I poured my heart into it. Doesn't anyone want it?
65871 All my life's work... for nothing. I'm such a failure.
65872 There's no reason to go on. Like Van Gogh, maybe I'll only be recognized when I'm dead.
65873 They said this one wasn't derivative. Is that why no one wants it? I'm too good! 
65874 I should have listened to my mother and become a lawyer.
65875 These zombies don't know anything about good art! Why did this have to happen?
65876 @There's a guy playing the slots in the [00CC00FF,Americana Casino ]- he just keeps going and going. Maybe you should check on him.
65877 Dammit! I thought I had that one for sure. Oh, well. Go again. 
65878 Frank, I'm seeing something strange in the South Plaza.
65879 @Oh my god, Frank, there's a security guard hanging people in the [00CC00FF,South Plaza]. Get over there now! 
65880 MUTINY AVERTED!
65881 @Please, don't denigrate my dreams! Anything less than [00CC00FF,$3000] means I'm not a true artist. I don't know why I even bother...
65882 You've made my dreams come true! It's all yours. Now let's get the hell out of here! Those zombies wouldn't know art if it hit them over the head!
65884 Oh, thank you so much! I was feeling like a raisin there for a moment. 
65885 @Now that you're feeling better, let's get you out of here. I know how to get to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
65886 @Thank you so much. But listen - since you are helping me, I can help you too. I know about the [00CC00FF,Safe House] and I know a [00CC00FF,shortcut] to the south side of Fortune. 
65887 @Oh, I'm so thirsty. I can barely move, much less fight off any zombies. I need something to [00CC00FF,drink].
65888 @Okay, here we are. The shortcut is through the changing room in the back and it will take us to [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza]. The [00CC00FF,Safe House] is right next door.
65889 @I work at [00CC00FF,Brand New U] on the second floor. Take me there, and I'll show you the [00CC00FF,shortcut].
65890 Frank, you'd better get back here. That guy Stuart has been talking to people about something, and now they insist on talking to you! 
65891 Frank, Stuart and a few others just left the Safe House. I heard them say something about making you pay for the outbreak. Be careful out there.
65892 @Hey Frank, there's a guy with a gun at [00CC00FF,The American Historium] in the [00CC00FF,Americana Casino]. He seems to be holding them back, but he might need help.
65893 @ANGEL LUST
65894 @Uh, this is going to sound strange, but there's a mermaid in a [00CC00FF,giant clamshell] at the [00CC00FF,Atlantica]. I think she's stranded. 
65895 @Hey Frank! There's a guy on top of the gambling slots in the [00CC00FF,Palisades]! He's surrounded by zombies, and he looks like he's having a panic attack.
65896 @Frank, there's a fire at the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Arena]. It looks like some people are trapped in one of the dressing rooms.
65897 @Frank, there's a guy on a yellow motorbike riding around [00CC00FF,Fortune Park]. You better check it out.
65898 @Frank, there are fireworks going off at the [00CC00FF,stage] at the [00CC00FF,Atlantica Casino]. Strange time to be performing wouldn't you say?
65899 @Hey Frank, there's some people sitting down in a [00CC00FF,theatre] at the [00CC00FF,Slot Ranch Casino]. It's like they're waiting for a show to start or something. 
65900 LaShawndra!
65901 Lady?!?! It's LaShawndra Dawkins! And hell no, I ain't all right.
65902 My good-for-nothing husband left me out here!
65903 Well, it isn't safe here. I know of a safe place nearby.
65904 @Alright. I'll go with you. Maybe we'll find Gordon's skinny ass on the way. We lost each other on the second floor of the [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza].
65905 Hey buddy, there are zombies everywhere! Come with me and I'll get you to a safe place.
65906 I can't... *sniff*... I'm a coward that doesn't deserve to live.
65907 I left my wife out there... I'm useless. A useless coward.
65908 Gordon Terence Dawkins is a useless coward!
65909 @C'mon buddy, just follow me back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. Maybe your wife is already there? She sounds like the sturdy type.
65910 She is a tough lady... Alright. I'll go with you.
65911 My little twerp of a husband left me!
65912 Is that "little twerp" a skinny guy, real nervous? 
65913 That's my Gordon! Bring me to him so I can regulate his ass!
65914 I'm such a coward. I can't believe I left my wife out there...
65915 Your wife wouldn't happen to be a... ummm... "big boned" woman in yellow, would she?
65916 You found my Pookums!
65917 Take me to her, please!
65918 That's her! That's my little water buffalo! Where is she?
65919 I'm really sorry, man. But she didn't make it...
65920 What? My LaShawndra is gone?
65921 I'm sorry, buddy.
65922 But what do I do now? How can I live without her?
65923 C'mon. We can't do this here, it's too dangerous. Just come with me. I promise it will be okay.
65924 *sniff*... I miss her already.
65925 That's my Gordon! Is he alright?!
65926 I'm really sorry, ma'am. But he had a... little accident. He didn't make it. 
65927 No... NO! Not my Gordon! *sniff* My baby! He was too weak. If he stayed, I could have protected his sorry ass...
65928 *sniff*... Alright. My little Gordon's gone to a better place.
65929 I hate to break up this lovely reunion, but it isn't safe out here.
65930 He's right. Let's go, Gordon.
65931 Yes, dear.
65932 Stop crying like a little baby and help me kill some zombies!
65933 I wish my daughter married a REAL man.
65934 Man up and help me boy! I don't know what my little Kazmina sees in you.
65935 Wow! +5 scale mail!
65936 @Frank, there's a group of four guys barricaded in a store in the [00CC00FF,South Plaza]. They're all huddled around something.
65937 You call that an attack? That couldn't hit a wood nymph!
65938 You'll never get the booty coming from that direction.
65939 No offense, but your skills need some serious work. And I'm not just talking about your character. 
65940 SHOOT THE DARKNESS!! SHOOT IT!
65941 Oh man, now I get to make out with an Elf Maiden.
65942 Do you think there might be girls alive out there still? 
65943 Hey, can I roll again? My character bio page says I don't have very good social skills for some reason...
65944 I'm a monster! *ROAR*
65945 My +10 vorpal sword should be able to handle this, no problem.
65946 Another critical hit!
65947 How did you get past our fortifications? You must be some kind of ninja!
65948 What are you guys doing here?
65949 We're playing Dragons of Snake Castle... duh.
65950 Stop distracting me! I'm in mortal battle with the Great Archdemon, Niwnskel. He is a nasty piece of work.
65951 So you guys are playing a game?! With that going on?
65952 I estimated that we would have an 87.326% chance of turning on each other in this situation if we weren't pre-occupied.
65953 ?
65954 I would explain things further, but judging by your whimsical facial expressions, you would only have a 16.2% chance of understanding.
65955 But more importantly, it's my turn now. 
65956 How did you guys get here?
65957 Gosh, sir! When the zombies came, we ran like HECK! *snort*
65958 We snuck in here and made a fort to stay safe. It's been terrible without my inhaler. *snort*
65959 Sorry, but you'll have to excuse me, *snort* I need to cast the Magical Fire Sphere.
65960 Hang on, I'm still casting. *snort*
65961 So you guys just want to stay here playing games?
65962 Yeah, we came to meet girls, but we've had no luck meeting any.
65963 Wait... That's a girl with you!!
65964 Oh, man! Guys, look up! This guy has a real girl with him! He must be really cool.
65965 Please, teach us how to be a stud like you?
65966 We couldn't meet any girls back home.
65967 We couldn't meet any girls on vacation.
65968 You know, maybe it's time to give up. 
65969 All this rejection! I just can't take it anymore!
65970 I don't need girls.
65971 From now on, I'm sticking to Action Figures.
65972 Action Figures?
65973 Yeah, they never reject me.
65974 They always look perfect, and they do whatever I want!
65975 @Look, it's not your fault. You did all you could. But back at the [00CC00FF,Safe House], your help is needed by people who are still alive. There's lots of good you could do there.
65976 Real live people? Okay, we can go. Maybe I can still make a difference. Or my medical supplies might come in handy.
65977 @Cinda went to the [00CC00FF,Cucina Donnacci] to look for some grub. She hasn't come back yet and I'm getting a bit worried. Please, we have to find her!
65978 Sure, pal. Let's have a look see.
65979 I found her in Cucina Donnacci. She's okay, but she wouldn't come with me.  She wants to make sure you are safe first.
65980 That stubborn girl... Please take me to her, we'll get this sorted out.
65981 Cucina Donnacci eh? Was she dressed in a uniform similar to yours?
65982 Yeah! That's her! That's Cinda!!
65983 Yeah, about that... She may have had a little accident...
65984 Accident?
65986 Damn... damn, Damn, DAMN! I knew I should have gone with her.
65987 @Really sorry, buddy, but we have to get outta here. There's a [00CC00FF,Safe House] here in town, though. I can take you there.
65988 Yeah... We better get going before the zombies sniff us out. I'm so sorry, Cinda. I hope you're in a better place now.
65989 Can you check on my girl? I won't forgive myself if something happens to her!
65990 I'm fine, dammit! Go check on Willa!
65991 Terri... my friend... she died trying to save me...
65992 Let's not let that sacrifice be in vain. Come on, I can get you to safety.
65993 Terri... I'm so sorry...
65994 Willa... my friend... she's dead. I wasn't strong enough to save her.
65995 You did what you could.
65996 It wasn't enough... It should have been me, not her. Oh, Willa!
65997 I'm sorry. But it's not safe here, you should come with me.
65998 I'm not leaving her here alone. She deserves that. She was a good woman. You go on if you need to. 
65999 Look, just leave me alone, okay? I'm not going anywhere. 
66000 Darling! My incompetent crew doesn't understand how exhausting it is to be a star! 
66001 @Darling! The hot desert winds are upon me.. Bring me [00CC00FF,something to refresh me] for the show! I'm parched! 
66002 What are you waiting for? I get soooo irrational when I'm thirsty! 
66003 @I can see two guys in [00CC00FF,Shank's Knife Shop] at the [00CC00FF,Palisades Mall]. Better hurry, I don't know how long they can hold out.
66004 @What is taking you so long? Are you deaf? Bring me a[00CC00FF, cooling restorative]! It's so hard to find good help these days.
66005 Ah! My drink! Now I can give my fans the voice they deserve! 
66006 Perfection! Now... It's time for the show to begin! Oh... oh my...
66007 You! Errand boy! Come! Over here!
66008 @Unacceptable! Go [00CC00FF,spiff yourself up] or this show is going to end with a BANG!
66009 Mmm, darling! You ARE mighty tasty! Ohhhh, YESSSS! Can you FEEL IT, handsome?! 
66010 @It's almost time for the show to begin, but where is my audience? Oh, handsome, won't you round up [00CC00FF,some fans] for the show? They are hungry for me! 
66011 @Hey... the state she's in now, she can't tell the difference between real and fake people... Isn't there anything you can bring to fake it? Even [00CC00FF,Zombies] will do.
66012 We cannot begin until ALL of my fans are here! There must be throngs outside, just waiting to get in! 
66013 @Umm...yeah. I guess. Why don't you come with me? Your fan club is waiting for you by the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. I would love to take you there.
66014 Darling, really?! Of... of course! I can't let the fans down! Bring me to them, handsome!
66016 Listen, I can help you out. I can usually figure out what her crazy talk means. She's a little...high strung. 
66017 Oh man, this just goes from bad to worse. I think I'll just take my chances on my own.
66018 You've ruined the show... Get away from me!
66019 Please... do as she says... or she will kill us all!
66020 She... she's mad! Please don't let her press that button! It's going to kill us all!
66021 Please.. help us... How was I supposed to gather people when they've all turned into ZOMBIES?!
66022 Darling, you were almost as incredible as moi. You... you are a TRUE FAN!
66023 @This gig is turning out to be more hazardous than we thought. We'll need another [00CC00FF,$5000] if you want our company. If not, we're outta here.
66024 @I can't believe she's gone. To honor her memory, it'll cost you another [00CC00FF,$5000] for us to come along. She would have wanted it that way.
66025 @Sorry, hun, but with her gone, it'll cost extra for my company. [00CC00FF,$5000] or I'll take my chances elsewhere. I gotta be twice the woman now. 
66026 Persistent, aren't you, sugar pants? I like that in a man. 
66027 Nice outfit. Kind I like to see on the floor in the morning. What did you say your name was?
66028 %1. %1 %2.
66029 A pleasure to meet you, delicious %1 %2. I'm Nina, Nina Suhr.
66030 The pleasure is mine, Nina.
66031 Cute, and a gentleman. You are an intriguing man, Mr. %2. I'd like to get under your skin. 
66032 You bat those zombies away like they were flies. You must be so strong. That's very hot.
66033 @If you talk to the boss lady, she'll ask for [00CC00FF,$10,000], but I like you, stranger. 
66034 I can get you a better deal. How about half price?
66035 @[00CC00FF,$5000] and you get all 3 of us. You won't find a better deal than that, hun. Half price for triple the action! 
66036 Remember, tiger. This was just for you, okay?
66037 Don't go telling your friends we came cheap. We're high class! 
66038 Frank... About those three girls you just brought in...
66039 What about them?
66040 Don't you think they're a little... forward?
66041 You know, you really don't have to pay for it... rescuing people, I mean... ummm...
66042 I better just get back to the monitors.
66043 @Frank, it looks like there's someone in a mascot costume over by the [00CC00FF,Kid's Choice Clothing ]in the [00CC00FF,Palisades]. 
66044 Better head back out there. I'll let you know when I find something.
66045 That was bloody awesome! Blimey, we love the fans! Let's go, mates. 
66046 You are dead meat!
66047 You ruined my clothes!
66048 I thought I could trust you!
66049 You scoundrel!
66050 Jerks like you need to be punished!
66051 I'll make you pay for crossing me!
66052 Didn't your mother teach you to be nice to women?
66053 I'll teach you!
66054 You have no respect for other people!
66055 We were both up for the Comedian of the Year, but these zombies stole the show, and they are one hard act to follow. 
66056 @We will each tell you our best joke, and you give the [00CC00FF,trophy] on the counter to the one you think is funniest. Which, obviously, will be me. 
66057 If you do that, we'll come along with you. If you can stand up after laughing your sweet ass off. 
66058 Hey Pal, you gotta help me out.
66059 Grandpa over there and I were both in town for the Fortune City Comedian of the Year award.
66060 I was killing the crowd with my jokes, then these zombies come around and start killing 'em for real! I can't stand to be upstaged!
66061 Those zombies are still out there, but if you follow me, I can get you to safety.
66062 Nothin' doin' pal, we were gonna find out who the Comedian of the Year was, and we ain't leaving till we do!
66063 @Just listen to my joke, and Walter's sad attempt, and give the [00CC00FF,trophy] on the counter to the funnier one.
66064 We'll follow you after I get my trophy. Because I am the man, my friends. 
66065 Okay, get ready to laugh.
66066 HA! Grains! That's pure comic genius, that is! Took me hours to think that up! Worthy of a trophy, eh? What do you say?
66067 If you're a tasteful man like myself, then you are sick of tired, old comedians trying to be funny and just ending up pathetic. It's just sad. 
66068 Allow me to lay down some fresh lines from the new hotness of comedy.
66069 Ha! That one gets me every time... stains...!! It's so good I'm almost making them myself! So what do you think?
66070 Naw man, I'm not following someone who doesn't know a good joke when they hear it.
66071 ...I could follow someone who pays the bills though. If you get my drift. This gig's gonna lead to lots of dry cleaning, know what I mean?
66072 @[00CC00FF,$5000] and I'll go along with you.
66073 @You want me to go? You better pay up then. [00CC00FF,$5000], take it or leave it.
66074 No thanks, I'll be hanging on to my trophy.
66075 Let him explain our little game first. Come on, it will be worth it.
66076 Hey, sugar plum! We're looking for another player for our poker game. Interested?
66077 Lady, there are zombies everywhere. We have to get out of here. I know a safe place.
66078 Now now, patience is a virtue. You might just get lucky, baby. 
66079 @Play [00CC00FF,poker] with us, and if you can beat us all, we'll go with you. Sound fair?
66080 @Just go to the table and [00CC00FF,pay the buy in], handsome. 
66081 Hey, there. I see you have the good looks of a gambling man. 
66082 A gambling man?
66083 Yessiree. My associates and I are looking for a sap... *ahem*... an esteemed gentleman like yourself, to play some poker with.
66084 Is everyone in this freakin' town insane?! There are zombies everywhere!
66085 Cool down a little. We are professionals. Nothing gets in the way of a good game of poker.
66086 @If you're man enough to play, [00CC00FF,pay the buy in] at the table.
66087 Where's the fire, friend?
66088 Have you looked outside? There are zombies everywhere. We need to get you all to safety. 
66089 Wait, just a second here. Let's not jump to conclusions. 
66090 Can't you see we're trying to have a game of poker here? Big stakes, pal. 
66091 Interested in playing? We could use another player.
66092 I see the appeal, but we have to get out of here. 
66093 @Hold on now. The only way I leave a game is if I'm outta chips. [00CC00FF,Beat us all], and we'll go with you.
66094 Are you crazy?!
66095 My pappy used to say, "Money talks." I'm sure you could use some extra cash yourself. What have you got to lose?
66096 @All you have to do is go to the table and [00CC00FF,pay the buy in].
66097 C'mon handsome. Just a little game of poker?
66098 @Too chicken to play? Or are you gonna man up and [00CC00FF,buy in]?
66099 My pappy used to say "If you don't get while the gettin's good, you are gonna get got".
66100 I'm not sure I follow...
66101 @Just sit down and play some [00CC00FF,poker]. Money talks
66102 Graaaaaaainnnns!!! Ahahahahaha!! Grains! Get it?
66103 Well, friend. It looks like you're holding all the cards. We'll follow you now.
66104 Staaaaaaiiiiiinnnnssss! Ohhh, snap!! Stains! I kill me! Ahahahaha!
66105 You beat us at our own game, cutie. I said we would follow you if you won, so let's go, sugar.
66106 Whoa. Tough crowd.
66107 You beat us all at our game, and took all our money, stranger. Guess you manned up, alright. Nothing for us left, but to follow you.
66108 I'm not giving up my old club for anything!
66109 I've worked my whole life for this. I finally have it. I'm not giving it up!
66110 Sorry, Sarge'll have me court-martialled for giving my gun to a civilian.
66111 You've gotta be stark raving mad if you think I'm giving up this gun.
66112 No way I'm giving this to you! It's way too hilarious!
66113 Ah, my adoring fans, welcome! Just a FEW MORE... And the show will begin! I know you can barely wait!
66114 @She won't be satisfied with anything less than a [00CC00FF,tuxedo].
66115 My boss is freaking out that her big comeback is turning out pretty small! She's wired us all with explosives... If she presses that button, we're all going out with a bang! Help! 
66116 @We were heading towards the [00CC00FF,Platinum Strip] before we got separated... Please tell 'im I'm here if you happen to find 'im.
66117 Your husband... Lady, he's not coming, I'm sorry. He didn't make it. 
66118 But, Chad... He was a'posed to find me. My baby...
66119 Come with me. I'll take you to a safe place.
66120 Chad? Older guy, fond of shotguns?
66121 That's him! Did you find him? Is he alright?
66122 @He's fine, and back in the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. Come with me, I'll take you there.
66123 Clearly it's not safe out here. Follow me to the Safe House.
66124 @It's not safe here. Let me take you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
66125 I... I have to find my daughter...
66126 Your daughter... yeah, I believe I met her on top of a roof...
66127 I'm sorry... she...she didn't make it. 
66128 No! Oh, my Lillian! How could I have let this happen?! I'll never forgive myself. Please, leave me alone with my grief. 
66129 She's...uh, she's just fine. Um, she's back at the Safe House. 
66130 Wait! You sound funny! You're lying, aren't you?! She's dead, isn't she? You're a liar!
66131 If he's with you, then where is he?
66132 I found him not too far from here. He's with me.
66133 I found her not too far from here. She's with me.
66134 I don't see her. Are you sure you have the right person?
66135 *Sigh*
66136 Okay, okay... I'm calm.
66137 Lady, I don't work here.
66138 The zombies are NOT toys. They are real zombies.
66139 There has been an accident and we need to get to safety.
66140 An accident? Real zombies? Why didn't you say so, instead of blathering on about whatnot?!
66141 It's just like you young people, constantly dilly dallying when something important is going on.
66142 Yeah... I'm sorry, but can we please get out of here now? We have to hurry.
66143 That's much better young man. I accept your apology, but I'm a little too old to hurry anymore. My bunions keep me from moving too fast.
66144 Just leave it to me.
66145 Well, then! Let's go, sonny. What are you waiting for? There are zombies out there!
66146 Not now, mister! Help me kill these here zombies, then we can chew the fat! 
66147 @It's dangerous out here, pal. Come on, the [00CC00FF,Safe House] isn't far from here.
66148 I ain't going nowhere until I find my Doris! You look like you've been around in this mess... You ain't seen my darlin' Doris, have ya?
66149 @Actually, I've met a woman by the [00CC00FF,Arena] looking for her husband. You must be Chad. Come on, I can show you where she is.
66150 You found my sweet Doris! Why didn't you say so in the first place? Let's go!
66151 Come get some zombies!
66152 You ain't gettin' past me!
66153 I'll take you all down, come on!
66154 This show makes me feel... cheap. I just want my family back. 
66155 @[00CC00FF,Exits] are upstairs. There's an elevator at the end of the hall, can't miss it.
66156 Anim
66157 Ah, my angel .My Trixie-Lynn. I done can't go on without my honey bear.
66158 You know, now that he's gone...I'm gonna be needin' some comfortin'. Know what I mean, hon?
66159 Ooh, you're a cute one, and so heroic. But we still can't git across that there fire door!
66160 Whoa! A live one! You must know how to take care of yourself, handsome!
66161 @You shouldn't be out here. I know a way to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. It's not far from here... let me take you somewhere safe.
66162 'Appreciate the thought, stranger, but I ain't going nowheres until my man Chad finds me here.
66163 Well now... Why don't you go 'stinguish that fire and then we go somewheres and make some heat of our own, cutey.
66164 Then when I finally get here, no one comes out to help me. For shame!
66165 Don't think I won't tell your manager, young man.
66166 @Frank, I see a woman trapped on of a booth in the [00CC00FF,Platinum Strip] near the [00CC00FF,Arena Entrance]. Be careful though, she's got a gun.
66167 It's okay, I'm in my underwear too. See?
66168 @Everything is all set up and ready to go for the show! Just go[00CC00FF, hit the button] on the control panel backstage.
66169 Oh my... Darling, you are simply not dressed for this caliber of a show! I cannot work under these conditions! 
66170 Get backstage, darling! It's time to start the show! Oh, baby! Can't you just feel the ENERGY!?
66171 @She wants something to [00CC00FF,drink], anything will do really. Please hurry! I don't want to die! 
66172 Julius
66173 Skylar
66174 Ted
66175 She'll kill us all now, buddy! Good job... Get out of here.
66176 Start the show
66177 We're safe now. Let's go!
66178 My adoring fans!... See how they love me? Wait... These... These aren't fans at all! Help me! SECURITY!
66179 @I think they carry them in the [00CC00FF,Modern Businessman] in the [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza].
66180 @I saw some [00CC00FF,firecrackers backstage] you could use to lure them, or you might be able to find something to use in the [00CC00FF,Food Court].
66181 Umm... What exactly does she want?
66182 You don't like it? I thought I was looking pretty good, myself. You have pretty high standards, lady. 
66183 Does she actually have any fans?
66184 The Diva is not ready yet.
66185 Whatever. Just leave her alone until the military gets here, Stuart.
66186 @It'll have to be something strong, some [00CC00FF,Whiskey] or [00CC00FF,Vodka] should do.
66187 Wow, you really know how to settle a dispute. That was KILLER.
66188 Ha! He always wanted to have a KILLER set.
66189 Alright. Let's go. With him gone, I'm sure to win the trophy next year!
66190 Thanks, Frank, but no thanks.
66191 Giving up so early handsome? Pay the buy in if you want to try again.
66192 That's too bad baby, but we'll be here if you want to try again. Just come back with the buy in.
66193 Thanks buddy, at least there are two of us in here who know real comedy.
66194 *Sniff * I won't, I am looking for my mother...
66200 Oh man! Have you seen that cowboy maniac outside? I am NOT going out there with him running around!
66201 What? You... you defeated Mr. High Noon? That's quite a feat! Are you some kind of an action star? You do look familiar...
66202 Oh yeah! You're Frank West! No WAY Frank West is the one that just saved us from Mr. Spaghetti Western!
66203 You don't have to worry about him anymore. I can take you somewhere much safer if you follow me. 
66204 I wanna say that this makes up for everything that happened... but it doesn't.
66205 Kind of a weird time to be hitting the gym, don't you think?
66206 Ha ha. Very funny, asshole. I'm just trying to find something to defend myself, but nothing in here is good enough.
66207 @Why don't we skip finding something and just get out of here? I know a way into the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. I can take you there.
66208 ...Did you just skip the part in your head where we have to go through them to get there?
66209 @Tell me you have a [00CC00FF,gun] at least. I'll go with you if I know you're packing.
66210 @Let me see if I can find a [00CC00FF,gun].
66211 So? You coming or not?
66212 @Got a [00CC00FF,gun] right here, pal. Locked and loaded, or whatever.
66213 Alright! That's way better than this stupid dumbbell. Lets go!
66214 You're a pretty good shot! Thanks for getting me back!
67701 You did a lot to help out my family today. Where I'm from, that deserves a reward.
67702 @Have a slice of what I got from the last leg of my Pro Tour. I'll also leave you my old club in case you need it. [00CC00FF,Reward: Luz's Old Nine Iron]
67703 Here's a little something for your trouble, darling. Don't spend it all in one place.
67705 That was one hell of a good time, mate! I figure you've earned a piece of our ticket sales from the show.
67706 Thanks for sharing the embarrassment with me, have a bit of my shopping money. Just, like, don't ask where I kept it or whatever.
67707 I gathered up some change from that fountain while I was stuck. Well, a lot of change. Take some!
67708 I got more than my fair share of tips last night. How about you take the extra for saving me?
67709 @Have a quest reward! It's just a small slice of my lucrative hot sauce endorsement deal. Also, take a look at this epic magazine! [00CC00FF,Reward: Eric's Video Game Magazine]
67729 I can see through the bag... lets just go... please.
67730 @Hey Frank, there's a guy looking through the shelves at [00CC00FF,The Man's Sport] in [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone]. Maybe he's seen some [00CC00FF,Zombrex]?
67732 @Hey Frank, there's a... interesting poker game starting up in the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. Might help you relax a little.
67733 I want to repay you for what you did. I found this Zombrex while I was looking for something to eat. Maybe you can use it?
67734 @I assume you are going back out there. I have some Zombrex here. Take it, just in case. I'll also leave my medical supplies in the lounge. [00CC00FF,Reward: Sven's Medic Bag, Zombrex]
67735 You kept your word, so here's a little something for your troubles. Buy yourself something nice.
67736 Just so you don't think I'm greedy, here's a little something for your help.
67737 Hey man, how's it going? How did you get past our security system?
67738 Security system?? The door was open. What's going on here?
67739 We're hiding out down here! You're looking at the Tape It Or Die crew!
67740 Tape it or Die?...
67741 Yeah, TIOD for short! We're the number one duct-tape-related zombie-killing-weapon fan site!
67742 You run a website down here? 
67743 Not just a website! A community AND killing resource! 
67744 We use regular, run-of-the-mill things, and turn them into instruments of Zombie Destruction! Fans from all across the world contribute their weapon ideas, and we build them!
67745 We're kind of survivalist down here. We've got the essentials to stay alive, and we're right under a mall, so we can get new supplies whenever we want! It's awesome.
67746 My name's Left Hand Lance, webmaster. And over there's Gretchen, Wallace and Johnny Pipes!
67747 Gretchen pays our bills - that's her by the TV there. Johnny Pipes founded the site - he's over by the fridge. Lastly, there's my buddy Wallace. He's trying to build stuff over by the workbench there.
67748 Wow. This is actually pretty amazing.
67749 Damn right it is. So, are you going back out there, dude?
67750 @Yeah, I'm looking for some things, but maybe you want to come and I can take you all to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]?
67751 No can do, my friend. We're starting to like it down here. But if you're looking for things topside, maybe you can help us out? Bring us some stuff, and maybe we can make you an awesome weapon?
67752 Talk to Wallace. There are some new submissions we want to try out. I'm sure he has a shopping list of items for you already.
67755 Help! I'm just a tech geek! I don't know how to fight!
67756 I think Wallace's new weapon attempt caught fire. Everyone ran out here, so I followed.
67757 @It's okay now, I'm here to help. Just come with me and we'll get you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
67758 Hey, I did not hear a knock!
67759 The door wasn't locked.
67760 Wasn't locked?! Damn, that must have been Jonathon. His caffeine-addled brain sometimes forgets even the simplest things. You still could have knocked...Who are you?
67761 The name's Frank West. Unfortunately happened to be in town when the outbreak started. But you must want to get somewhere safer. 
67762 Tempting. But now may be a bad time to leave, as Tape It Or Die is beginning to pay dividends.
67763 What's Tape it or Die?
67764 It's a website where people gather and design weapons from household items to fend off zombies. I financed everything, and look where it got me. But the site's starting to come into its own.
67765 I'm becoming a little unsure about the morality of it all, but we have to survive, right? Luckily we have food and water and supplies.
67766 The four of us have been staying here since the outbreak began. It's been terrible, but our fans have sent weapon ideas to help save others - and ourselves - from the zombies.
67767 @Well, I've got to take off now, guys. Sure you don't want me to take you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]? 
67768 That's mighty kind of you, but this is the safest place there is. But maybe you can help us out. We need new materials so that loafer, Wallace, can build some new weapons.
67769 So I would appreciate it if you'd chat with him for a bit before taking off!
67770 Wallace's over at the workbench.
67771 Now we can't get back in. Thank god you came to save us.
67772 They're everywhere! Help!
67773 Thank god you came back. Wallace yelled "fire", so we all came out. Johnny locked the keys inside and now we can't get back in.
67774 @It's okay. We'll get out of here and back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House], okay? 
67775 Oh, wow! You're new! Johnny Pipes likes that!
67776 Huh?... Look buddy, we have to get out of here. There are zombies everywhere out there!
67777 No kidding! Ain't it a blast?
67778 Oh, you're serious! But we can't leave! Things are starting to get fun! Tape It Or Die is becoming bigger than ever!
67779 What's Tape it or Die?
67780 Website! For zombie fans. And zombie-killing fans. And tape fans, too! It's a community. People get together. Share ideas. Make zombie killing machines out of everyday items. Duct tape is beautiful!
67781 Like I said, I'm Johnny Pipes. Best plumber in the western United States. Also, I founded Tape It Or Die. My brainchild. I'm in charge.
67782 @Nice to meet you guys, but we really should get out of here and back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
67783 No, no, no! Things are picking up! We're becoming relevant in the world. Money and lady-folk are sure to follow! How about you? You could join the crew, too! Fifth member?
67784 Thanks, but I've got to get back topside and do some investigating.
67785 Topside? Brave move! You're a brave guy! Reminds me of me. Maybe you can be of use. Maybe you can help us! Interested?
67786 We need some new weapons. New supplies! Stuff to work on. I'd like to go out myself. But I'm low on caffeine right now. Too tired. Bad state to be in. Probably get bitten. But you! You can get the stuff! Right?
67787 Go talk to Wallace. He's at the workbench. Trying to build something good. Prove his worth, it seems. Ain't it cute?
67788 Talk to Wallace. He'll have the "shopping list". Easy stuff! Now go make Johnny Pipes proud!
67790 Johnny Pipes needs help!
67791 Damn, I'm off-kilter today. Need some caffeine. Supercharge my system. Or some lady-folk. Same effect.
67792 @Focus, man, focus! Just slow down and follow me. Let's get you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. After that, you can do your thing.
67793 Jeez, Lance! Can't you see I'm busy?
67794 Sorry, buddy. I'm no "Lance". 
67795 Huh?
67796 Hey, you're Frank West! Wow! How'd you get in here?
67797 It was pretty easy. The door wasn't locked, so I came in.
67798 That's some great security we've got here. A zombie could walk right in!
67799 Lucky for you I'm no zombie. But what's going on here, anyway?
67800 Heh, it is a little strange, isn't it? We're the surviving members of Tape it or Die.
67801 What's Tape it or Die?
67802 We're a website that encourages folks to design do-it-yourself weapons to take on the zombie hordes. It was all fun and games when we began, but the outbreak happened, and well, here we are, making real weapons.
67803 I get that you have a cool project here, but it's not safe. Look, if you come with me, I can get you to safety.
67804 Oh, we're safe down here. And we have access to supplies above! But, you're a real hero, surviving out there alone. You going back out?
67805 Yeah, I got some business to attend to. 
67806 Maybe we can help each other? I want to build some weapons for the crew. But I need a couple things. If you get 'em for me, I'll show you the designs. And they are awesome.
67807 You're looking for some stuff out there in Fortune City?
67808 @Yeah. I need a [00CC00FF,Cement Saw] and a stack of [00CC00FF,Plates]. Bring me those and I'll build you something awesome!
67809 @Were you able to find a [00CC00FF,Cement Saw] and the [00CC00FF,Plates] up there?
67810 This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
67811 We can't get back inside! And all of our weapons are in there!
67812 Thanks for the save, but all that work... down the drain.
67813 @Don't worry, you might get a book contract out of this. Stay close and I'll get you to the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
67814 Okay, now I'll just connect this to this and... THERE!
67815 Not quite done yet. I can't work while someone's watching. Just come back later.
67816 Wallace's been all focused since you brought those things back. Like a new man or something.
67817 I hope this one is better than that lighter fluid and blender combination. My eyebrows just grew back.
67818 Ha HA, he's trying to outbuild Johnny Pipes. Friendly rivalries are great!
67819 Here it is, my latest and greatest! I hope it serves you well.
67820 @Remember, I still need a [00CC00FF,Cement Saw]. It's gonna be so awesome! 
67821 @Remember, I still need some [00CC00FF,Plates]. Very important for this one. 
67822 Thanks again for helping me get that together. I think I proved my worth because of you. Maybe we can work together again someday?
67823 You know, that one may actually work.
67824 I'm a little worried. That thing looks dangerous.
67825 Nice, Wally! Almost as good as Johnny Pipes!
67826 We came out for an extinguisher! Now the keys and my mini-wrench keychain are locked inside. Damn!
67827 One of my weapon attempts caught fire. We were looking for something to put it out. It's probably trash now, just like everything else...
67842 @Some people hacked into our emergency lines. They said something about [00CC00FF,"Tape It Or Die"]. It sounds important.

67848 Wow, this place is much better than our old spot. We could build tons in here!
67849 That was more than I could take. No more. I don't feel right doing this kind of thing anymore.
67850 What a rush! Gotta go back! Smash more stuff! I LOVE this town!

67865 It's hopeless...
67866 @This poor guy got injured in the outbreak. Not bitten, but a big wound. My [00CC00FF,Zombrex] couldn't even help! He was bleeding so much, man. The zombies could smell him. 
67867 The smell made the zombies hungry, and they broke into my first aid room, so we had to leave. We ran in here. I thought we might be safe.
67868 I'm such an idiot. Of course, they could smell him in here too.
67869 I couldn't save him...I tried so hard. Maybe someone else could have... I'm such a failure.
67870 Get that dang thing off your head, boy!
67871 If you weren't married to my little girl, I'd leave your good-for-nothing ass here!
67872 Quit blubbering and help me with these zombies, you sorry excuse for a man!
67873 @Better see if he's up to leaving. He's the fool over there in the [00CC00FF,helmet].
67874 @How the hell is that [00CC00FF,helmet] supposed to help if a zombie bites his arm?
67875 Or anything else he's got hanging under that pin head of his...
67876 Damn, I can't believe he's actually dead. My daughter's gonna be sad for a while...
67877 Aw, shoot! Look at the bright side! Now, hopefully, I won't have any "loser" grandkids.
67878 ... ?...
67879 You know what? Forget I said anything. Let's just get outta here.
67880 Are they all gone? I hate those things! 
67881 Yeah, but we better get out of here, there are more coming. I can get you to safety.
67882 Thanks. Kenneth over there brought me here to make a man out of me. He's my father-in-law, but I don't think he respects me at all.
67883 I really love my wife Kazmina, but it's like he doesn't like me at all. Can you help? 
67884 Sorry, but we don't have time to solve all your problems now. We should go.
67885 I was just looking to play a little poker and try to bond with Kenneth.
67886 *ahem*...
67887 Right... One thing before we go.
67888 He's gone... I thought my father-in-law was tough enough to outlive us all.
67889 I'm sorry he didn't make it, look, we better just go. I can get you to safety.
67890 Okay. *Sob* How can I tell Kazmina her father is dead!? Let's just say I tried to save him, okay? 
67891 Wow that was close, you really saved our bacon back there. Here take this -  it's my latest design. Maybe you can use it?
67892 So I hear you sweet-talked Nina?
67893 Now we don't usually give discounts, but if Nina likes you, then I like you.
67894 @It'll only cost you [00CC00FF,$5000] now.
67895 @[00CC00FF,$5000] for the 3 of us is just too good to pass up.
67896 @Talk to the boss-lady, [00CC00FF,Cora]. She can pencil in some time for you.
67897 Thanks, handsome. I'm all yours, bruiser.
67898 Thanks, I'm liking you more and more.
67899 I'm just...broken up. They're both gone.
67900 Sorry, but you know the drill, sugar. Even in mourning, time is money. 
67901 @This time it's [00CC00FF,$10,000], but you get me all to yourself, stud. 
67902 Thanks, stud, but now that my friends are gone, we'll have to work extra hard. *giggle*
67903 I can't believe this! My girls are both done and gone. 
67904 You're a real cutie, but this job was too much for us. 
67905 I'm really sorry about that. They seemed like...nice girls. But we need to get out of here. 
67906 No, baby. I'm all choked up right now. 
67907 @...unless you've got an extra [00CC00FF,$10,000] to distract me from my pain, I'm staying right here. 
67908 @[00CC00FF,$10,000] if you want my company, baby. I'll make it worth your while. 
67909 Thanks, baby. You sure know how to comfort. Now let's make sure you get what you paid for.
67910 Oh, my girls! I learned so much from them! Now they're both...dead.
67911 I'm real sorry, but we've got to get going. 
67912 Didn't you hear me, baby? I'm grieving for my people....
67913 @It'll be at least [00CC00FF,$10,000] for me to go anywhere now.

67956 I'm gonna need me some Zombrex from now on. Good thing Phenotrans left a nice little gift basket full of it.
67957 I needed me some nice new undies. You better make sure that's the magnum size. XXL, bitch!
67958 Ooh yeah, guess your girl Rebecca needs that to stop the bleeding. Nothing else is helping.
67959 Yeah, I need those painkillers to shut your little bitch up. Her whimpering is messing with my mellow.
67960 I see you found some sutures. If you're good, maybe we can use them to close up your girl's wounds.
67961 For once you didn't mess it up, Frank! You gonna bring that all back to TK, you hear?
67962 What is taking so long? You got it all. Now bring your ass back to the arena.
67963 You gonna get back here with my things, Frankie? You better come when I call, boy.
67964 @Frank, can you get back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]? [00CC00FF,Richard] is harassing some of the girls here.
67965 @There are two guys hanging from the railings on the second floor of the [00CC00FF,Palisades]! What are they doing?! They're going to fall!
67966 @I see a woman in [00CC00FF,Hot Excitorama] on the [00CC00FF,Silver Strip]. She looks like a police officer. 
67967 @Hey Frank, there's a young man stuck near the [00CC00FF,Amusement Park]. It looks like he's crying.
67968 @There's a woman in the [00CC00FF,underground], and a few of TK's goons are shooting at her. She needs help!
67969 I'm gonna get some pictures of this, you stay out of sight.
67970 Whoa, how did you keep up with that train long enough to find me?

67975 Frank... you made it. You're alive.
67976 I have a little experience with this kind of thing. Are you okay?
67977 I guess we got some practice. I can't believe we were using these things for entertainment... 
67978 I don't know what's worse. Them eating all of us, or us slaughtering corpses on television for 'fun'.
67979 Terror is Reality is definitely a fitting name.
67980 @Do you think we could discuss the poetic justice of the situation back at the [00CC00FF,Safe House]?
67981 Sorry. This whole situation just has me thinking about my sister. She's the whole reason I was on the show.
67982 Maybe TK will give us the gold medal now?
67983 I gotta ask: How do your knees not hurt after what you did on Terror is Reality?!
67984 Don't go too far, Frankie. The Slicecyles are coming up soon!
67985 Ball Launcher
67986 She got infected two years ago, and I'm sure I don't need to tell you how expensive Zombrex is.
67987 I barely won enough to get her some, and now I'm stuck here instead of getting the money to her.
67988 Kinda funny, in a way. We need Zombrex, so we kill zombies... but then we get infected, then more people need Zombrex...
67989 Can we go before you need Zombrex, too?
67990 Good point. Lets go.
67991 How did you get here?!
67992 Did you not hear that postal service guy? He left me here as a 'delivery'. Dunno what that means, but he gave major creep vibes...
67993 Yeah, thanks. He didn't hurt me, but he thought I was a toy. He said I was a package he had to deliver to the Emergency Shelter, but he left me here instead..
67994 @Huh. Well, he was kind of right. There's a way to the [00CC00FF,Safe House] right through this vent. Let me show you.
67995 I might be the first person who isn't mad they were kidnapped.
67996 Are you alright?
67997 Wait, really? Here I thought he was treating me like a 'package' cuz he was a total weirdo.
67998 When I get back home, I'm watching my favorite movie on VHS.
70001 Well, who do we have here?
70002 Mr. Frankie West, Terror is Reality star. I guess you think you're a big man now?
70003 Well, I bet nothing about you is particularly big. 
70004 Or maybe you just don't... ride much. 
70006 Go on, Frank. Take the money and run. 
70007 I don't see much reason for you to keep going out there anymore, buddy. So you lost this story, there will be others. 
70008 Why so glum? Pal, you're gonna see some ugly things out there. Give yourself a break and stay put for a while. 
70009 Dad, I wish you could stay here now. There are bad people out there. 
70010 Yay! You're back, dad! I worried about you. 
70011 Dad, you look sad. Wanna come play Mega Man? 
70012 @Do you think Rebecca's okay? You better get over to the [00CC00FF,Americana] and see what's happening to her!
70013 I'm glad you got her out of there. She and I might not always get along, but we need her to get to the bottom of this thing. 
70014 Frank! What happened? You didn't get there on time! Rebecca...well, she's gone, Frank. She's gone. 
70015 Help Frank!
70016 I lost more than just a story Sullivan...
70017 I'll check it out. Don't worry.
70018 It was the twins that worked for TK, just trying to get us out of the way. He's behind this whole thing.
70019 Now we'll never get to the bottom of this. All we can do now is wait for the military rescue. 
70020 Don't worry about me, honey. Daddy knows how to deal with the bad people.
70021 I'm just fine, honey. Just checking up on a friend. 
70022 Sorry, honey. Your dad... I might have to go away for a while when we get out of here. But don't worry about that now.
70023 @Frank, I'm worried for Rebecca. This source might be more than she can handle. Get to [00CC00FF,Bennie Jack's ]at the [00CC00FF,Americana ]fast!
70024 It's hard to find what you're looking for out there. I like it right here, myself. Safe and sound. 
70025 Untie Rebecca
70026 Look, you can keep going out there, but when the military rolls in, that's it. Got me? 
70027 I've just got a few things I got to take care of. 
70028 Dad, I really want to go home soon.
70029 The rescue is coming very soon, honey. And Daddy needs to make sure he has everything he needs before then. 
70030 @Rebecca should be at the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Hotel ]by now. You better get there quick.
70031 That's right. The chopper'll be leaving the city soon.
70032 Hey, Frank. Don't forget that Rebecca's waiting for you up on the Safe House Rooftop. 
70033 I heard you were after that TV guy! Are you serious? You sure have some crazy ideas.
70034 He's behind this whole thing. But it doesn't matter now. He's long gone. 
70035 I still can't believe it! But I got this guy covered, Frank. He's not getting out of this room.
70036 Thanks, Sullivan. Keep a close eye on him. Let us know if he wakes up.
70037 What was on the roof, Dad?
70038 @I saw a helicopter on the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Hotel] roof! I'm going to go check it out.
70039 Dad! I'm so glad you're back. 
70040 Thanks, sweetie. Me too. 
70041 Are you okay, Dad? You don't look good. 
70042 I'm just a little upset, that's all. One of the bad men got away.
70043 @The helicopter is landing on the roof of the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Hotel]! Looks like there are elevators in the lobby you can use to get up there.
70044 Thanks, Stacey! On my way. 
70045 I don't like having that TK in here, even if he is handcuffed. We can't trust him.
70046 I know. We'll have to keep an eye on him. 
70047 I can't believe he got away. He killed all those people, and the world will never know. 
70048 We'll never get to the bottom of this now.
70049 I'm bored, Dad! Can we play?
70050 How about I find you a toy?
70051 I'm sorry the story got away Frank, but there might be people alive out there.
70052 See what kinda trouble being nosey gets you into?  Reporters are all the same...
70053 Is that my medicine? I hope so...
70054 It hurts, daddy...
70055 Hang in there, kiddo!

70058 In the future, it would help you to look before you leap.
70059 @I can't believe TK is holding Rebecca for [00CC00FF,$1 million].
70060 That's a lot of money to just give up, but time's running out Frank.
70061 @There's a guy standing near the entrance to the [00CC00FF,Atlantica Casino]. It looks like he's carrying some sort of brief case.
70062 I know, I know. Zombrex is hard to find.
70063 Been a long time since I had to pay for a woman...
70064 Your kid's not looking so good, buddy. You sure you got it under control? 
70065 Don't worry about it. She'll be fine. 
70066 ... I mean... don't you have somewhere to be?
70067 Your kid's looking really bad, pal. Does she need her Zombrex?
70068 Look, I'm doing the best I can here. 
70069 I'm so sorry, Frank...
70070 I heard what happened, pal. I'm really sorry things went down this way.
70071 Thanks, Dad. I feel better already.
70072 Thanks for being strong, kiddo.
70073 Thank goodness you got her Zombrex in time.
70074 I need to make sure I always have a Zombrex for her. Every single day. 
70075 She's doing okay? Your little girl? 
70076 Thanks, Sullivan. She's doing just fine.
70077 Dad, I kinda wanna go home now. Can we? 
70078 @Not just yet. Sit tight kiddo, I'll need to give you [00CC00FF,Zombrex] in a few hours.
70079 I hope this story is worth the trouble.
70080 They just keep coming!  I can't stop them...
70081 ...I just can't do this...
70082 I'm so cold...
70083 Hang in there, pumpkin.
70084 @Frank, it's almost 7:00 AM again. You better start looking for[00CC00FF, Zombrex].
70085 Thanks for the reminder. I'll try to find some.
70086 Frank, you have to get enough money to save Rebecca. This city is full of cash. Do whatever you have to do.
70089 @Frank, Katey's getting worse. Have you found any[00CC00FF, Zombrex] yet?
70090 Don't worry, Stacey. I'm on it.
70092 @You've got plenty of [00CC00FF,Zombrex] for your kid, right? Like you said?
70093 No problem, Sullivan. Got it under control. 
70095 @Katey is getting worse by the minute. Don't you have her [00CC00FF,Zombrex]!? 
70096 If only there was a better supply of this stuff.
70097 Frank, I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say...
70098 I... I just couldn't find any in time. I failed her. I failed Katey.
70099 I'm sorry, pal. I thought you had some. I had no idea. 
70100 It doesn't hurt as much. Thanks, Dad.
70101 You're brave, kiddo.
70102 Katey looks like she's doing a lot better.
70103 What a relief. Finding Zombrex every day is seriously stressful.
70104 Your kid managing okay? She sure is cute. 
70105 She's just fine, Sullivan. Thanks for asking.
70106 Rebecca...
70107 If only I saved her in time...
70108 Frank, you tried your best... If she had listened to me and stayed in the Safe House, this wouldn't have happened.
70109 I've got no leads now... The trail's gone cold.
70110 Hey, Dad? Did something bad happen?
70111 Don't you worry about a thing, kiddo. Let Daddy do that. 
70112 @Frank, you've got to help Rebecca! It looked like she was fleeing to the [00CC00FF, Underground Loading Bay].
70113 Don't worry, Stacey. I'll save her.
70114 Sheesh, these crazy lady reporters. Bring her back in one piece, Frank.
70115 I don't know what's going on out there, but I'll bring her back.
70116 Did something happen to Miss Rebecca, Daddy?
70117 She's in a little trouble, honey. I'll help her.
70118 We'll figure something out, Frank.
70120 She got herself into that mess. You tried your best, Frank.
70121 It wasn't good enough.
70122 Daddy, are you ok?
70123 Daddy had a hard day, sweetie.
70124 Hey Frank, I thought you said you wanted some shots of the military rolling in?
70125 @Hey Frank, remember you need [00CC00FF,Zombrex] between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.
70126 @It's getting close to 7:00 AM again, Frank. I think you better start looking for[00CC00FF, Zombrex].
70127 Frank, Rebecca is hurt. You have to bring her back here.
70128 I'll get her back safe.
70129 I told you she'd get herself hurt! Just make sure she's ok.
70130 I'll take care of her.
70131 Is Miss Rebecca ok, daddy?
70132 She'll be fine.
70133 What happened, Frank? You were supposed to bring Rebecca back.
70134 I couldn't make it in time.
70135 Don't feel too bad, Frank. She was the one who insisted on putting herself in danger. 
70136 I did the best I can.
70137 What happened, Daddy? Were is Miss Rebecca?
70138 Nothing to worry about, honey. It'll be ok.
70142 What were you doing out there, exactly? You've got your Zombrex under control, right? Please don't make my life any harder, buddy. 
70143 Don't you worry about it. I'm on it.
70148 Oh, Frank. I'm so, so sorry about Katey. She turned so fast. 
70149 It's not your fault. I'm sorry you had to see that. Oh, Katey. I failed you.
70150 Why the long face, pal? What's the matter? Is your daughter okay? 
70151 She ... she didn't make it. 
70154 @Frank, I'll try to help you on the PA system. You'll need to make some sort of generator that can hack the [00CC00FF,Broken Panel] outside the Security Room.
70155 @If you can hack the [00CC00FF,Broken Panel] you will be able to release the [00CC00FF,Back-up Security Gate].
70156 @Find a [00CC00FF,Generator], [00CC00FF,Gas Barrel] and [00CC00FF,Spool of Wire] and bring them to the Broken Panel.
70157 Combine the 3 items to hack the Broken Panel and close the Security Gate!
70158 Good jump, Frank! You fixed the door!
70159 I don't know how those doors got opened.
70160 What happened to you during this whole mess?
70161 I was trying to find TK. He got out of the First Aid room and brained me. 
70162 Daddy, are those zombies in the hall going to get in again?
70163 Don't worry, sweetie. That gate will keep them out.
70164 Once again you save the day. Thanks, Frank.
70165 Don't forget about the other brave people that helped.
70166 Hey Frank, TK's zombie bite looks pretty bad.
70167 @I can't believe I'm saying this, but you should consider giving him [00CC00FF,Zombrex] when you return.
70168 @Come on Frankie Boy, you going to help me out? How about some[00CC00FF, Zombrex], buddy ol' pal.
70169 I ain't your buddy but maybe, if I'm feeling generous.
70170 @He'll turn if you don't get him [00CC00FF,Zombrex].
70171 He won't be much use to anyone then. You'll have to take care of it. 
70172 You have to stop him, Frank! For poor Rebecca's sake! We owe her that. 
70173 I'll get him, don't worry!
70174 I heard a bang, Frankie boy. Somebody get shot?
70175 Don't push me, TK!
70176 @Frank, I saw Sullivan head for the [00CC00FF,Fortune Park] exit from [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza]!
70177 @Sullivan is heading into the [00CC00FF,Yucatan Casino], Frank!
70178 @Frank, It looked like Sullivan was trying to break open those locked [00CC00FF,elevators in Yucatan]. He must be going to the roof.
70179 Use the winch to bring it down! It's the only way to stop it! 
70180 Frank, throw something into its rotor. 
70181 Winch the helicopter and throw objects to damage its rotor.
70182 Take that thing out, Frank! Wow, this is really great material for my story! 
70183 @He got away... I'm so sorry, Frank. You'd better get back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
70184 Frank, we're almost out of time! The firebombing is coming soon - You've got to stop Sullivan! And we might be able to use his phone to call for help!
70185 Let my hands go so I can do that myself! What are you, my daddy?
70186 Don't you worry, TK. You'll have plenty of daddies when you get to prison.
70187 You didn't deserve this Sullivan.
70188 I can't believe I didn't see through that bitch's lies.
70189 You could've been great, kid...
70190 We could have been great...

77511 Rebecca Chang
77512 Katey West
77513 Dad, I really don't feel good. 
77514 It's okay, honey. Daddy's gonna get your medicine.
77516 Frank! What are you doing?!?! Katey really needs some Zombrex!
77517 @Frank, Katey wants to see you. I think you should come back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
77518 @Hey Frank, Rebecca looks hurt. You better get her back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. 
77519 Summer 
77523 Frank! Zombies are in the Lounge! You have to save everyone!
77525 @Thanks, Frank. I really owe you one. Can you help me get back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]?
77526 Frank, make sure Rebbeca is ok. 
77527 Is Rebbeca going to be ok, daddy?

77531 I just need to get supplies to the Security Gate Console.
77532 Frank, I can see the things you need on the security cameras.
77533 @Looks like there's a generator in the [00CC00FF,Leisure Room].
77534 @Hey, there's some fuel stored near the [00CC00FF,First Aid Room]!
77535 @I can see a large spool of heavy-duty wires next to the [00CC00FF,Storage Room]!
77536 Let me know if you need anything else, and I'll see if I can find it for you.
77537 Look at you, found them all did ya? Don't keep me waiting... I might get bored and... well... you get the idea.
77538 I know some people who aren't going to be happy when I get my hands on that. 
77539 Hey Frankie boy, what is it they say about the Champagne Room?
77540 Can you see the whole city from up there buddy? 
77541 White really isn't my style, but those geeks pull it off.
77542 What the hell are you tryin', Frank? Bring me the things I asked for first!
77543 You're wasting your time, Frankie! You get my stuff, then we talk.
77544 Hurry up, boy! I want my stuff! Don't you want what's yours? Or you want me to keep them for playthings? 
77545 @Frank, it looks like there's someone cooking at [00CC00FF,Cucina Donnacci ]in the [00CC00FF,Food Court]. You better check it out.
77546 Where were you, pal? You missed the big news. 
77547 There just wasn't enough time.
77548 Frank, we were in the lounge! Didn't you see us? 
77549 I thought you were in the security room.
77550 What were you doing, Frank? You didn't get back in time.
77551 It's crazy out there. I guess I lost track of time.
77552 Everyone looks upset, Daddy.
77553 I'm afraid things didn't go as planned. 
77554 Daddy, I think everyone is in the lounge.
77555 Thanks, kiddo. I'll go see what's up.
77556 Frank, we're all in the lounge. Come meet us there.
77557 You're going to get yourself killed going into those tunnels.
77558 I have to see what's happening down there. It's our last chance. 
77559 What happened down there, Frank? Just a red herring? 
77560 Figures...  Biggest story of my career, and I'm stuck nursing this leg.  I wish I could be out there with you Frank.
77561 You stay here where it's safe. I'll get to the bottom of this thing. 
77562 Frank, Rebecca wants to know if you found anything out. Do you know where the gas was coming from? 
77563 It's crazy out there. I lost track of time. 
77564 Where are you going, Dad?
77565 I'll be fine, sweetie. Don't worry about me.
77566 Dad, why are you sad? Can we go now?
77567 Honey, we just have to wait a little while. Don't you worry. 
77568 @Frank, you should be able to make your way down to the tunnels using the [00CC00FF,Maintenance Door] in [00CC00FF,South Plaza].
77569 Thanks, I'll check it out.
77570 What happened, Frank? Couldn't you find anything?
77571 I just ran out of time.
77572 Safe House secured.
77573 @Frank, the rescue will be here soon. I'll bet that you can get some great pictures from the [00CC00FF,Royal Flush ][00CC00FF,R][00CC00FF,ooftop].
77574 @Hey, Frank, can you come back to the [00CC00FF,Security Room] for a minute? I want you to have a look at something.
77575 Hey, Frank. Rebecca's back and she wants to talk to you. Can you head back here now?
77576 Ah-ah-ah, Frankie. If you don't have my merchandise, these ladies are gonna be dropping in on some zombies. And I do mean dropping... hehehehehe.
77577 No, no, Frankie boy. You turn right around. Bring me the goods, or these girls are done for, you hear me?
77578 You are one sorry man, you know that? Are you listening? Bring me the goods, or say goodbye to the girls.
77579 @You're gonna have to get me some pics of a certain Phenotrans executive enjoying the company of several ladies - and one gentleman - of the evening. They're in the security room of the[00CC00FF, Americana Casino].
77580 @I'm gonna need a USB drive that one of my men dropped on the train platform near the [00CC00FF,Food Court]. It's got some... compromising information on it.
77581 @There's a case of queens in the [00CC00FF,Laboratory]. That is gonna come in very handy. You'll need to get that, sucker.
77582 @That dimwit Sullivan dropped his cute lil' headset on the [00CC00FF,roof] before you tore his ass in two. I'm gonna need that.
77583 Where you going in such a hurry? Buddy, you really need to learn to relax.
77584 I'm just hoping to find... a friend. Don't worry about me.
77585 I appreciate you're in a bind, pal. But you keep your nose clean around here. 
77586 Frank, we've got to find out who's framing CURE. 
77587 Dad, why is everyone so upset? Why do they think you did something bad?
77588 I know there's evidence out there. Somebody knows something. I just have to find it, too.
77589 And we will. Frank West doesn't know how to give up on a story.
77590 Don't worry about it, honey. It's just a misunderstanding. I'll straighten it all out. 
77591 @There's gonna be a Phenotrans lab coat somewhere in that pharmacy in the [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza]. And you're gonna get it for me.
77592 And to thank me for my hard work, Phenotrans kindly left me a gift basket. Of Zombrex.
77593 Nice of you to pick those things up for me, but you know what... I ran outta champagne while I was waiting.
77594 You better hurry, little man. My patience is wearing thin.
77595 Now you all done, Franklin. If you hurry back to the arena, Rebecca might still be able to thank you.
77596 Don't worry, Frankie. I gave your little one her Zombrex. Wouldn't want you to miss the show. I have a much more entertaining end in mind for her! 
77597 @I'm just going to take some pictures. You can make it all the way back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House] through the Americana now. Might even be a restroom... if you have the need, Frank.

77603 Frank, they're starting to report the outbreak on the news. It's playing on the TV here, you should come back and watch this.
77604 Oh my...I'm so sorry, Frank.
77605 Hey, what's wrong?
77606 I just got some terrible news. I have no reason to continue...there's no point now. 
77607 I know of a safe place. I can take you there if you come with me. 
77608 @Frank, did you find anything out from that guy? Get back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House], I need to know.
77611 Frank, I don't know what to say... I'm so sorry, Katey didn't make it.
77615 You were right about TK, Sullivan.  We should have tossed him outside when we had the chance.
77616 I found something interesting. I'll fill you guys in when I get back to the Safe House.
77617 Great, take care out there. Come back in one piece.
77618 I couldn't make it there in time...

77680 It was TK. He's the one behind this outbreak. I was chasing him and some thugs but he got away.
77681 I can't believe the host of that horrible show is behind this. But that's going to have to wait for now, Frank. Katey is going to need more Zombrex soon.

77730 Richard, what's going on? I heard you're annoying some of the other people.
77731 Annoying? I was just getting better "acquainted" with some of the ladies.
77732 "No" means "no" buddy, if they don't want to talk to you, you should just leave them alone.
77733 You've kept me bottled up for long enough. I need to release some of this...
77734 Stop! I don't wanna hear it.
77735 First all the food is gone and now I can't talk to my girlfriends.
77736 @They aren't your girlfriends!! I think there might be a [00CC00FF,magazine] that will help in the Hot Excitorama store on the Silver Strip.
77737 A magazine huh?  I can make due with that. Please hurry though, I'm already feeling "frisky", if you know what I mean.
77738 @Frank, I need something to "occupy" me so I can "release" some "tension", like that [00CC00FF,magazine] you were talking about in the [00CC00FF,Hot Excitorama].
77739 Hi officer, are you alright?
77740 @Oh hi, I'm not a real officer. I just play one in [00CC00FF,The Peephole] gentlemen's club. Do you like my outfit?
77741 Yeah, that is quite an "outfit".  I'm a little confused by the bowling pin though?
77742 I like to use props when I'm performing. Maybe I can show you sometime?
77743 I love a good show, but right now we should to get you to a safe place. Follow me.
77744 *Giggle* I love a man that takes charge. Say no more.
77745 What?  These things usually cost $10... Fine, since this will keep me busy and you went through all that trouble... I'll be in the bathroom if you need me.
77746 Hey, are you ok?
77747 Oh you took care of them, I am fine. If those cowards did not have weapons, my fists would have brought them all to an end.
77748 You sure were taking care of business. Where'd you learn to fight like that?
77749 I'm a world champion in many deadly arts. Master taught me well.
77750 I'll say! Well... I can show you how to get to the Safe House.  Keep close though, there are plenty of zombies to fight.
77751 I hope your skill can match mine.
77752 Real men need no guns.  Are you too weak to fight me with your own strength?

77754 You fight with no honor.

77759 Tournament? What Tournament?
77760 The Fortune City Video Game Championships. I'm expected to win a number of events.
77761 Tournaments for playing games... Sounds like fun kiddo, but if you want to spend another roll of quarters, you better follow me.
77762 Great let's group. I usually play solo but maybe all we need is some co-op play?
77763 I have no idea what you are talking about but stay close.
77764 No thanks baby, no tellin' when I'll find another one of these.
77765 Hey, what are you doing old man?  The safety rail is there for a reason.
77766 I was making a run for it when I got surrounded. Only way I could get away was to jump over.
77767 Seems like you didn't think this one through... Look, I can get you to a safe place but I'll need you to drop down. You okay with that?
77768 If it gets me out of this predicament, then I'm all for it!
77769 @Okay I see a [00CC00FF,big stuffed animal] down there that might work.
77770 Thanks, but I also saw some dimwit pull the same move on the other side of the mall. He wasn't even surrounded.  He looked at me and just jumped over.
77771 Alright let's get you down first and then worry about the "dimwit".
77772 These old arms could give out at anytime so you better hurry.
77773 Hey you want a hand up?
77774 I'm not sure... It's pretty dangerous on your side of the railing.  I saw another guy over there doing this and he looked safe to me, so I tried it out.
77775 Wait, let me get this straight. There's someone else hanging from the 2nd floor and you think you're safe hanging from here?
77776 Well... uhh... maybe not, but at least "they" haven't gotten to me yet.
77777 Look I can get you to a safe place but I don't think I can pull you up. I need to get something you can drop onto.
77778 Well it better be big and soft or I'm not dropping man!
77779 @I don't think you have much of a choice but I can see a [00CC00FF,big stuffed animal] that should work.

81711 @Rebecca Chang looked like she was in the [00CC00FF,Fortune City Hotel].
81712 I sure as hell hope she can help me figure out what's going on. 
81713 What's going on, daddy?
81714 Nothing, sweetie. I'll be back soon. 
81715 @I saw some men breaking into the underground through a door in the [00CC00FF,Palisades Mall].
81716 I better check it out. This could be our best lead. 
81717 @It looks like they set up to raid the vaults in the [00CC00FF,Americana, Slot Ranch Casino] and [00CC00FF,Yucatan].
81718 Don't worry about me, you already know I've covered wars.
81719 Dad, how come you keep leaving?
81720 I'm sorry, kiddo. I've got some important stuff to do out there. But I'll be careful. Don't worry.
81721 Good job on that drill, Frank, but I'm still seeing TK's goons out there. Be careful.
81722 TK is still moving in heavy equipment, and more of those thugs are showing up as well. I'm worried, Frank.
81723 Frank, this is getting dangerous. There are still more of TK's goons in the city.
81724 I don't like you going out there. You should stay here where it's safe.

81731 Tim Duggan
81732 @You've got two women waiting for you in the [00CC00FF,Security Room].  *Hmph* It's been quite a while since I got attention like that.
81733 You feel that explosion from outside? No need to worry though, we're behind 5 feet of the best fortifications the US government could buy.
81734 Better stay in here where it's safe.
81735 I heard you might have stopped the heist of the century. Not bad.  If you were a lot younger, Fortune City Security might've been able to use you.
81736 You gave it your all Frank. Nothing to do now but wait for the army. Then this'll all get sorted.
81737 I'm glad you made it back safely. Thanks for, you know, everything.
81738 Don't mention it.  We'll get to the bottom of this in no time.
81739 Yeah... well, she's a cute kid.
81740 I know you tried, but he still got away. Without proof, no one is going to believe that is wasn't CURE's fault.
81741 Well, look on the bright side, at least you've got your health.
81742 Dad, I leveled up in Mega Man! But I missed you. 
81743 That's my girl! I missed you too. 
81744 Stacey was worried. She didn't want me to see you on the screens. I guess she doesn't know you that good, huh? 
81745 What's the matter, Dad? You look sad. 
81746 ...Nothing, honey... just promise me, no matter what, you'll be a good girl. Okay?
81747 Sure, Dad. But how come? 
81748 Just promise me. Please?
81749 ... um...Okay, daddy, I promise.
81750 Be careful Frank, those men are probably armed to the teeth.
81751 @Those men have set up at the vaults in the [00CC00FF,Americana], the [00CC00FF,Slot Ranch Casino ]and the [00CC00FF,Yucatan].
81752 Do what you have to, but just be careful.
81753 I knew something was strange with that guy when he approached CURE.  Be careful Frank, who knows what he's capable of...
81754 You did what you could Frank.  But without any leads, there is nothing to prove my innocence.
81755 I swear that guy was a new recruit.  I've never seen him before this rally.
81756 You are always in such a hurry in and out of here.  You should slow down sometimes and think things through.  
81757 That Stacey is in the security office.  She's been looking for you.
81758 I used to think all that training was a waste of time.  With all that's going on now, I sure am glad for all those days in the academy.
81759 Buck up son.  So you didn't get your big scoop, big deal, right?  You can find a new one after the army picks us up.
81800 What's up?
81801 Sorry, you were saying?
81802 Sorry about that, keep going.
81803 TK's goons are still robbing the city. Stop them all.

85349 I let it slide every time, but that's on me.

85361 Oh, Stuart! It wasn't supposed to be like this.
85362 I'm sorry, I was just defending myself and it got out of hand. If you want, I can take you some place safe.
85363 Yeah, ok...I guess so.
85364 Let's get going, try to keep up.
85365 If you keep going out there, you're bound to find trouble. I'd stay put if I was you.
85366 Trouble has a way of finding you when you sit still, Sullivan. But thanks for the concern.
85367 You've got some explaining to do, Stacey. That guy said he was a part of CURE!
85368 I know how it looks Frank, but CURE had nothing to do with this outbreak.
85369 Easy for you to say, now that the evidence has vanished...
85370 That would be nice honey. 
85371 You alright, Frank?
85372 I've been better, Sullivan. To say the least. 
85373 I wouldn't go out there if I were you, but if you do see anyone else in trouble, bring 'em on back, okay? 
85374 Will do, Sullivan. I'll keep going out there until I find what I need.
85375 Dad, why do you have to leave again? Don't you want to play?
85376 I do, honey. And I promise I will once I find what I need. 
85377 Frank, you lost your chance. Those men underground are gone now. 
85378 I know, dammit! That was the lead we needed. 
85379 Daddy, what's wrong? 
85380 It's nothing kiddo, don't worry about me. 
85381 I wonder what those guys were up to in the underground tunnels.
85382 I guess it doesn't matter now, anyway. 
85383 What was TK up to down there?
85384 I don't know, but we need to find out soon, so we can clear your name and get to the bottom of this. 
85385 Yay, you're back. Can you find me something to play with?
85386 Maybe I can find you some toys out there. 
85387 I was worried about you, pal. Plenty of trouble out there. 
85388 Don't I know it, buddy. But I have to get to the bottom of this thing.

85431 @You're out of Zombrex? I hear it [00CC00FF,lasts for 24 hours] now, when do you need your dose?
85432 @I have to take it [00CC00FF,between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM].
85433 @There is a store called [00CC00FF,Roy's Mart] in [00CC00FF,Royal Flush Plaza] that has a pharmacy. There could be some Zombrex in there.
85434 Thanks, I'll check it out.
85435 @I bet if you go to [00CC00FF,Roy's Mart in Royal Flush Plaza] you could find some Zombrex.
85436 @Are you going to go find some [00CC00FF,Zombrex] Daddy?
85437 Don't worry, kiddo. I'll find you some.
85438 @Did you find some [00CC00FF,Zombrex] yet, daddy?
85439 I'm still looking, kiddo. You just hang on. 
85440 I'm glad you found some Zombrex, Frank, but it's not time to take it yet. Right? 
85441 @I need my daily dose [00CC00FF,between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM]. I'll take it then.
85442 @Don't forget to take your Zombrex [00CC00FF,between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.]
85443 It's not time for my Zombrex, Dad. Right? 
85444 @I know, sweetie. I'll be back at the usual time, [00CC00FF,between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.] I was just wondering how you're doing. 
85445 I'm ok. I'm glad you found some Zombrex. 
85446 @Frank, isn't it time to take [00CC00FF,Zombrex]?
85447 Yeah it is, I haven't found any yet.
85448 Frank, you're going to need Zombrex in less than an hour. You have to find some quickly!
85449 @Frank... you aren't going to believe this, but it looks like a rock concert is going on in the [00CC00FF,Silver Strip] stage.
85450 @You really should check out [00CC00FF,Roy's Mart] for [00CC00FF,Zombrex]. There is a good chance there is some there. 
85451 I saw that you found Zombrex. But you don't need it yet, right? Just don't forget to take it.
85452 Frank, don't forget that you need to take your Zombrex sometime in the next hour.
85453 Frank, it's just a half hour until your next dose. You really need to take your Zombrex now!
85454 @The time is 7:30 AM. Do you still need to find [00CC00FF,Zombrex]? Katey only has [00CC00FF,30 minutes before she'll turn.]
85455 @I know there isn't much time, I'll check out [00CC00FF,Roy's Mart].
85461 So, did you find some Zombrex?
85462 Yeah, I found some.
85463 Hook me up, bro. I don't want to turn!
85464 This little baddy could get you out of a jam.
85465 Man, I hate needles. That blows I have to do this every 24 hours. Zombrex sucks. 
85466 Talk to me before you head out there, Frank.
85467 Look, I don't know if I can trust you. But if you're going to keep bringing people back, I got something that might help you out. 
85468 I promise I won't get in your way. What is it? 
85469 @Supposed to be a key to all the [00CC00FF,Maintenance Rooms] around Fortune City. Dunno, might be something useful in them.

85471 Have y'all seen my man, Chad?
85472 Yeah, he's gone a little crazy. He keeps attacking me. 
85473 What you dun!? You're a gonna pay, mister! 
85474 You leave him alone!
85475 Hey, that's my wife! Doris! Why she tryin' to beat the snake skin right off you, boy?! 
85476 She's just gone a little mad. I don't know how to stop her. 
85477 If you dun anythin' to my girl, you better run like hell! 
85478 Pard'ner, you seen my wife, Doris? Real sparkplug, that gal!
85479 I'm sorry...I'm afraid she didn't make it. 
85480 My Doris?! My sugar bee? My honey pot? Tarnation and damnation! 
85481 I know how it feels, pal. But listen, I know a safe place. Why don't you come with me?
85482 Dang. Alright, pard'ner. But lemme tell ya, the wet just went right out of my whistle. Oh, Doris! 
85483 I can't take that now, daddy. It's too early. You know that. 
85484 @I know sweetie, I'll come back between [00CC00FF,7:00AM and 8:00AM]. Just like always. 
85485 I'm relieved you found some more Zombrex, but you know it's not time to give it to Katey.
85486 @I know, I'll be back between [00CC00FF,7:00AM and 8:00AM.]
85487 You should give that Zombrex you found to Katey now. She's not doing so well.
85488 It's not time for my shot, is it?
85489 No, kiddo. It's still too early. 
85490 I'm really glad you keep finding Zombrex. It's horrible for people to be so dependent on it. So expensive, and so hard to find. 
85491 Looks like it's still too early to give it to her. 
85492 Yup, I'll have to wait until 7:00AM.
85493 It's time for Katey's shot now. Why don't you go give it to her?
85494 Good job, Frank! You found more Zombrex.
85495 I wish this stuff lasted longer. It's getting hard to find. 
85496 I'll be back when it's time to give it to her.
85497 I found more Zombrex, kiddo.
85498 Thanks, Daddy. How long until I need my shot?
85499 Soon, it's not time yet.
85500 It's that time again. Why don't you give Katey her dose?

86260 @The [00CC00FF,Emergency Shelter] they briefed us on before the show is near here. Let me take you there.
86261 You're not gonna hear any complaints from me. Lets go.
90000 I can't believe I just did that. 
90001 I feel like such a sellout.
90002 Hey, do you know how I can get the hell out of here?
90003 Green room? Yeah.
90004 Yeah. Take the elevator up a floor and then straight down the hallway.
90005 You can't miss it.
90006 Time to shoot guns, make money and play dirty like real Americans in...
90007 Oh, we robbed the retirement home for this bunch!
90008 I'm gonna just toss some zombies at these clowns, see if they wake up. 
90009 As long as these players are making fools of themselves, let's have some... 
90010 Hey!
90011 I know you're holding out on us! Where's the money?! Where's the safe?!
90012 We don't have a safe!
90013 Don't lie to...
90014 Hey! Don't you have something better to do?
90015 Why don't you mind your own business old man?
90016 Exactly what I'm doing.
90017 Just looking for some meds. No need to get ugly.
90018 Well, you're definitely gonna need some painkillers when I'm done with you.
90019 Well, talking to you is giving me a headache.
90020 Oh yeah? What say you give me some money, and I'll go get some for you?
90021 Yeah - give us some money, Grandpa!
90022 We'll help you out.
90023 How about it Grandpa? You got any money?
90024 Come on! Don't lie to me!
90025 You should be ashamed of yourself! You're nothing but a common criminal!
90026 You've caused nothing but trouble.
90027 CURE is innocent! It's a setup!
90028 I saw your buddies on TV, lady. I saw your picture.
90029 Hey!
90030 And a man like you, a real American, helping out trash like this.
90031 You don't need that kind of publicity, pal.
90032 Sullivan, I think CURE's being set up.
90033 I saw it on the TV. With my own eyes.
90034 Explain how that little trick works.
90035 There's something else going on here, Sullivan.
90036 I found some evidence at the arena of a cover up.
90037 I've got a feeling TK, the host of that game show, is involved somehow.
90038 I saw him backstage, at his show, swapping a briefcase of money
90039 with the guy they showed on TV starting this outbreak.
90040 Ahem - you could have told me that the front door was locked.
90041 Hey, you're that TV lady.
90042 I'll make you a deal.
90043 You two do your little investigation, you see if you can help this troublemaker.
90044 But ain't no one gonna cover her ass when the military arrives.
90045 And she ain't allowed off the premises. I'll be guarding the door.
90046 Don't think I won't do what I have to do.
90047 What was that all about?
90048 He just takes his job too seriously.
90049 Tell me you found something.
90050 We checked out central security. Someone's definitely trying to hide something.
90051 Everything was smashed to pieces.
90052 This is my, uh... new friend.
90053 Stacey - I'm Rebecca Chang. Channel 6 Action News. I'm here to help.
90054 Fantastic.
90055 Oh. You'll forgive me if I don't think it's very helpful
90056 Look, I don't know what's going on here, but clearly things are not as they seem.
90057 I put out the information I had at the time.
90058 Hey, I love a good catfight, 
90059 Works for me. Whether you're innocent - or guilty, I just want the truth.
90060 Oh, that is painful to watch. 
90061 Thanks for the vote of confidence.
90062 But okay, we'll work together.
90063 I'll keep an eye on these monitors.
90064 And I'm going back out there to see what I can find out.
90065 I'll let you know if I see anything.
90066 @Remember my [00A5D2FF,Zombrex]
90067 @Katey will need [00A5D2FF,Zombrex]
90068 that you accused my organization of a crime we didn't commit.
90069 but we're not getting anywhere unless we work together, ladies.
90070 Blue Unit! They're heading down tunnel B-5!
90071 The Fortune City incident.
90072 People always ask me about it.
90073 Check. Get into position. They're within range.
90074 Why didn't you cover it? Why didn't you break the story?
90075 Why weren't you there, Frank?
90076 They're ten meters out. Get ready.
90077 Well I wasn't.
90078 Okay, get ready... we're gonna hit 'em in 3...2....1! Go!
90079 Chuck Greene was. 
90080 He broke the story. 
90081 Uncovered the conspiracy. Became a hero.
90082 Got famous.
90083 The next question people always ask is
90084 Zombies took our Willamette! They took our Las Vegas! 
90085 well, if you'd been there, what would you have done differently?
90086 But tonight, America, we're going to get a little payback! 
90087 My answer:
90088 Everything.
90089 Welcome, everyone, to Fortune City, Nevada!
90090 America's entertainment playground! 
90091 Frank West is back in the game.
90092 @Frank, I'm seeing something weird. There's two bikers trying to get into the Terror is Reality backstage at the [00CC00FF,Arena]. They might need help!
90093 Lucky for you two, I know a safe place. Think you can keep up?
90094 @[00CC00FF,SCOOP: ]With No Handlebars\0A[00CC00FF,BIO: ]A biker just trying to survive. Found in the Arena.
90095 But here in paradise - America's biggest nightmare! Caged but not tamed! 
90096 Shut up, Argyle! I'd rather not get eaten by zombies than fix my damn bike. Lead the way!
90097 I guess we're not fixing our bikes...
90098 Tonight! Real American warriors - authentic survivors of zombie outbreaks - will face off with the nightmares of their past! They come together to compete for cash prizes in a series of deadly events. These true American heroes are here to confront their past... face their fears... and to grab onto hope!
90099 Do you think we can get down there?
90100 I hope so. After that crash, I doubt we're getting our bikes working again.
90101 What are we going to do if all their bikes are gone already?
90102 Maybe we can use some parts to fix ours up. It's better than sitting here doing nothing.
90103 Hey, man. We're trying to get into the backstage to get some parts for our bikes.
90104 Actually, aren't you the guy on these posters around here? Frank West?
90105 Holy shit, you're right! Do you know how to get down there?!
90106 And now it's time for America's most dangerous game show!
90107 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, guys, but that elevator is completely busted. I pried it open when the outbreak started.
90108 It's time for...
90109 Terror is Reality!
90110 A biker trying to survive. A little too eager. Found in the Entrance Plaza.
90111 And here's your host: Tyrone King!
90112 Hey, buddy! You gotta help us... We had to jump from the second floor. Our legs are busted.
90113 Well America?
90114 Are you hungry for a little terror!
90115 @[00CC00FF,All three of you?!] I don't think I have enough arms...
90116 Because tonight, we're gonna give it to you!
90117 @[00CC00FF,SCOOP: ]I Fought the Security\0A[00CC00FF,BIO: ]Terror is Reality security officer. Lover of potato chips. Found in the Royal Flush Plaza.
90118 Our contestants are almost ready.
90119 So let's send them a little message:
90120 You've gotta be willing to risk it all if you're ever really gonna...
90121 @It might be easier to get one of our [00CC00FF,Security Carts]. I think Julius left his by [00CC00FF,In The Closet].
90122 WIN BIG!
90123 People, are these players still in kindergarten?
90124 Well maybe we can get some action that's not right off the playground with this last round! 
90125 But we gonna mess with them kiddies a little. 
90126 Our leader gets to start first, and everyone else trickles in behind. 
90127 Let's give it up for our winner, America!! Come on over here, baby!! You the king!! 
90128 I know what you're thinking! Gimme gimme gimme some money, baby!
90129 No need to pay for it tonight, baby! Just like TK! 
90130 Excuse me, sir?
90131 CAPCOM presents
90132 A Keiji Inafune Game
90133 A Blue Castle Games Development
90134 What is it kid?
90135 Yeah, sorry sir, it's just paperwork. They want it from everyone.
90136 Would you mind if I got your autograph?
90137 You've always been a big hero of mine, Mr. West.
90138 I was really bummed when your show went off the air.
90139 I signed your waiver, you got my next of kin.
90140 Are the vultures circling already?
90141 Wow, thanks.
90142 Uh... sure.
90143 Sorry about that. It's just, uh...
90144 Uh... yeah. I guess so.
90145 Our first contestant is also a survivor of the Las Vegas outbreak. He's been a sanitation worker for 10 long years. Let's hear it for Bobby Newland! Our second contestant comes to us from the original zombie playground - Willamette Colorado. He's also a world champion barista! Welcome Roland Nichol! Our third contestant... he raced his way directly out of Las Vegas and onto our stage tonight. He's Leon Bell - motorcycle enthusiast!
90146 So I guess this would be worth quite a bit if anything happened to you out there tonight.
90147 Thanks Mr. West.
90148 ...it's been a while.
90149 Good luck out there.
90150 Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.
90151 @I guess it's that or I carry you one by one. I'll [00CC00FF,talk to you] when I figured out what I want to do.
90152 Okay, I'm ready. Lets go.
90153 That's our show for tonight! It's all about the payback, people! And the filthy filthy money!!
90154 Stay classy, America! Just like TK! 
90155 And finally we have a two-time National Motocross Champion who lost everything in the Las Vegas outbreak... he's a Single Father... he's a SURVIVOR... he's... Frank West! 
90156 We'll do our best to cover you. Just promise me you'll get them somewhere safe!
90157 I think Terror is Reality needs to do some zombie outbreak training procedures. We're not paid enough for this shit.
90158 TK has a very special surprise for you.
90159 He is the original zombie killer himself!
90160 The one, the only, Frank West!
90161 So, Fortune City!
90162 Now, we in for a show. 
90163 The rematch of all rematches!
90164 Now, Frank's gotta kill zombies to earn cash. 
90165 The bigger the death, the bigger the payoff.
90166 Especially if you use those corner grinders.
90167 I do like a good grinding.
90168 But first, TK has got a personal message just for you, Frank West.
90169 You gotta be willing to risk it all if you're ever really gonna...
90170 WIN BIG!

90192 @Uhhh... Frank? I don't even know how to describe what I'm seeing, but I'm betting you'll want to head [00CC00FF,underground]. Quickly.
90193 Heya, Playboy! Whatcha doin' down here? We're havin' a LOT of fun! Blast them away, girlies!
90194 And show some love for our player tonight. 
90195 None other than the famous zombie killer... FRANK WEST!
90196 Am I dreaming?
90197 D'aww, aren't you sweet! We work for the casinos, silly! We're just, you know, unwinding after a long, hard days work.
90198 We love you, TK!!
90199 He's taking a break from hawking those baldness remedies to earn him some real cash.
90200 ...
90201 Yoohoo? Helloooo?! My eyes are up here, Playboy...
90202 Well, even if you ladies are having fun, this isn't safe. There's a group of survivors nearby. I can take you there.
90203 Awwww, that's no fun, Playboy! We just got to the good part! Well, I guess we're running low on ammo anyway. Girlies! We gotta move! Follow the old guy!
90204 Frank West. This must be so embarrassing for you.

90208 So right now, let me hear you make some noise!
90209 Hehehehehe! Bang! Bangbangbangbang!
90210 My arms feel like jelly shooting this thing...
90211 I'm too scared to say anything. I'm worried Olivia and Catherine got a little too into character here...
90212 Seriously, you worry way too much. It's bad for your health.

90216 This seems to have only compounded the problems which have 
90217 been linked to the beef shortages in local areas.
90218 Good job, girlies! Keep shooting!

90223 The zombie rights group CURE is in the news again.
90224 The protest group have shown up in the adult playground of Fortune City,
90225 which was chosen as the site of the latest installment of the 
90226 pay-per-view game show, Terror is Reality.
90227 The protest just compounds the problems of the game show,
90228 which has been plagued recently by tumbling ratings and controversy.
90229 CURE was on the site of the show to display their opposition
90230 to what they call the unethical treatment of zombies.
90231 Stacey Forsythe, the leader of the Nevada branch of CURE, had this to say:
90232 Public opinion is mixed on the groups views, 
90233 which are sometimes seen as radical.

90411 It's Fortune City, Frank. The land of riches. Get creative.
90412 Bring it to the Shoal Nightclub 
90413 and we might just let you see your little girlfriend again.
90414 Don't you touch her.
90415 I have been told that we have received a broadcast from our field reporter 
90416 Rebecca Chang, who is inside Fortune City.
90417 We're stunt drivers. We had some plans for our next show, but we thought these might be better against the zombies.
90418 It is clear that the outbreak started in the Fortune City arena, during last night's 
90419 "Terror is Reality" show. Information received from a behind the scenes source 
90420 reveals that this outbreak was not an accident, but rather an act of terrorism.
90421 Ah, Rebecca. Look at you. Not the weather girl anymore.
90422 Kind of a personal question to ask when we just met, don't you think?
90423 We need to get out of here! It's too dangerous!
90424 Thanks, man. I'm done with Terror is Reality after this.
90425 Keep rolling! 
90426 This shocking footage was obtained from a source inside the Fortune City arena, 
90427 the site of the Terror is Reality game show. It may be upsetting to some viewers.
90428 Please, you have to help me! Please! Me and my friends were down there and then all the zombies just came out of nowhere!
90429 Hey, hey! Look at me! Take a second and breathe. Do you have any idea where they might have gone?
90430 Initial reports suggest that the man in the video
90431 is a member of the protest group CURE.
90432 Authorities speculate that CURE was attempting to discredit Terror is Reality,
90433 or to shock Americans out of what CURE sees as their complacency.
90434 CURE?
90435 No statement of responsibility has yet been received.
90436 over his wife's death in the Vegas outbreak. 
90437 This horrible act of terror appears to be an escalation of violence for the protest group.

90596 You have to believe me.
90597 @Hey! Frank West, right? I thought I saw someone come out of the vents earlier. Did you come from the [00CC00FF,Emergency Shelter]?
90598 How did you know that?
90599 I'll tell you what I believe: TK paid him to destroy his own show.
90600 But why?
90601 I'm a huge fan of yours. I know you used the vents in Willamette. I've read your book like, 6 times. I'd be willing to bet you're doing the same now.
90602 But first things first - she needs another Zombrex dose tomorrow morning.
90603 Well, you're right. It's just around the corner. Come on and I'll show you.

90623 Frank, that guy was a new recruit. I never saw him before this protest.
90624 Yeah, that's a good one.
90625 Of course. TK must have planted this guy in our group. To do his dirty work.

91011 Sorry kiddo. Time for your medicine.
91012 Has extreme survivors guilt. Made it to the Safe House before the doors shut when the outbreak started.
91013 Frank - the rescue is coming soon.
91014 Sullivan said they'll save anyone at the bunker at first light.
91015 There still might be people out there that we can help.
91016 If you can get them back here in time...

91020 It never stops, does it?
91025 Hey, rookie! You're shooting into the sun.
91026 Besides, from my spot I can already see the military.
91027 Aren't you supposed to be watching TK?
91028 Didn't want to miss the rescue. Don't worry - he's out cold.
91029 Likes to do the right thing. Found at the Medical Office in Uranus Zone.
91030 @Now just gimme back my [00CC00FF,Six Shooter] and we can git goin'!
91031 Hey, looks like they're coming over the bridge!
91032 *glug glug glug* Ahhh! Nothin' like some strong whiskey to get the heart pumpin', right partner? Hoo! Much better!
91033 We're at the first checkpoint. Raise the bridge.
91034 @Hey, man. Any chance you have more [00CC00FF,Zombrex] on you before Sullivan puts a bullet in my head?
91035 You know the drill! First we mop up, then we grab the survivors.
91036 Start with the north end, move down!
91037 Sir, yes sir!
91038 Let's go, let's go!
91039 Ready to kick some ass, ladies?
91040 All right.
91041 Whoa, whoa, hold your fire!
91042 @Liam Needs [00A5D2FF,Zombrex]
91043 Thanks for getting us out of there. Here's some money from his last performance - I'm his manager, so he doesn't get to complain.
91044 Hey, Jonesy! That looks like your mother-in-law! You want me to take her out?
91045 Hey, look at this waste of ammo!
91046 What the hell?
91047 First kill belongs to Daddy, sweethearts!
91048 Nice shot, sir.
91049 Have at it, boys!
91050 Hoo-rah!
91051 Fantastic.
91052 Come on over, sweetheart. Hey look, I don't even gotta buy her dinner! 
91053 @Frank, you better bring some more [00CC00FF,Zombrex] for [00CC00FF,Liam]. Sullivan says that he'll do whatever he has to if you don't get back here soon.
91054 What the hell?
91055 Jesus! Did you see that?!?
91056 Come on, drop you son of a bitch! Come on!
91057 Get it away from me! Get it away from me - 
91058 My face! Oh god, it burns, it burns! Help me, it burns!
91059 Get us out of here, man!! They're killing us! They're killing us!
91060 Can't see shit in this fog, man.
91061 Liam, come on. That's a little dark.
91062 Back up! Back up! Get us out now!
91063 Hold still man, I'll shoot it off!
91064 Medic! I need a medic here!
91065 Come on! Drive! Drive! Over there!! Come on, move it!
91066 Sarge! Sarge! You gotta get us outta here!
91067 They're all around us! I think they're all around us!
91068 Shin!
91069 Rebecca. What are you doing down there?
91070 You're going to get yourself killed.
91075 What the hell just happened?
91076 Zombies can't take out a military column. They can't - can they?
91077 Sullivan's been pretty clear he's not letting anything mess up the military's arrival tomorrow. I think part of him wants to just get it over with.
91078 @Can you hook me up with one more dose of [00CC00FF,Zombrex] before that happens? The military should have more for me tomorrow.
91079 Regular zombies can't. But those...what happened to them? 
91080 If you ever make a t-shirt, I'm buying it in every color. Thanks man.
91081 @GOAL: Bring Zombrex to Sarah \0ADESTINATION: Safe House \0AIt's no surprise [00CC00FF,Sarah's] infected. She's going to need [00CC00FF,Zombrex]. I should bring some back before Sullivan deals with it himself.
91082 Look! It's Rebecca! What is she thinking?!?
91083 Thanks! Now, what was I saying? Oh, yeah...
91084 You think I sent you on that scavenger hunt just for you to take it back?
91085 I've got to go get her...
91086 No, Daddy! Didn't you see?!
91087 Sorry, man. Shoulda grabbed one for you if you wanted one!
91088 Pfft! Thanks bro. This place is like, totally awesome.
91089 That was the military rescue? How the hell do we get out of here now?
91090 Yeah right, soldier!! Who's gonna carry you if you take my rifle from me?!
91091 We're going to have to go out there and find a way out ourselves.
91092 Sorry, man. Shoulda grabbed one for you if you wanted to snipe them! This is awesome!
91093 Thanks, sport! If you don't mind me, I'm just gonna admire the blade you got me...
91094 Now everybody wait a minute. There's another part to standard operating procedure.
91095 Lauren
91096 Lauren Dougall
91097 My understanding is if there's a problem with the rescue operation,
91098 there'll be another attempt in 24 hours - if it looks like there's any survivors.

91107 I'm the only reserve man who made it here alive, and I'm doing my damnedest.
91108 Whoa! Lauren! DILF alert!
91109 DILF? I'm not even that old!
91110 Like, oh my God, Court. You're kinda right! He's something, huh? Kinda has that "I don't care, but I do" thing going for him.
91111 I'm standing right here, ladies.
91112 And what if that rescue fails? Huh? Everything else has gone wrong so far.
91113 Sorry! We've just been like, SO bored since the whole zombie thing, you know? It's been LAAAAAME. We wanted to just jam and have fun, you know?
91114 Hell yeah! We'll always have our girls night out, zombies or not, right Court?
91115 Firebombing. It's the only way to get rid of 'em. For good.
91116 YES! Court and Lauren forever, babes! Chrystal's a babe too, but she's not in the party mood.
91117 @Okay... well, would you ladies like to continue your night out at the [00CC00FF,Safe House]?
91118 Firebombing?
91119 I have to go get Rebecca.
91120 Frank - be careful. If those things can take out the military...
91121 @A [00CC00FF,Safe House]? Sounds boring. What're we supposed to do?! We just got here! Let us have some fun first, at least.
91122 Yeah! There's no service and we had to get all the lights going ourselves. Chrystal's already giving me the glare over there!
91125 Suck on this, you bastards!!
91126 @Maybe if we had some [00CC00FF,local cocktails], we'd be satisfied enough to go back with you.
91127 You're totally right, Court! I could just LIVE in this club! Hahaha!
91128 8-Ball, they're coming from the left flank! 
91129 Delish! Alright, I'll come back to your 'Safe House' with you.
91130 Talk to Courtney if you wanna gossip! Ugh... Where's my drink?
91131 @Something's going on... there's a whole of lights and music happening over at [00CC00FF,Shoal Nightclub] in the [00CC00FF,Yucatan]. Someone must be in there.

91153 I can't believe a worthless zombie did me in...

91175 What happened to the zombies out there? They went... berserk.
91176 We had a lot of time to kill and came up with this. Maybe you'll get some use out of it. Thanks for saving our asses.
91177 There was some sort of gas... 
91178 As soon as the zombies came in contact with it, they... changed.
91179 Hey, sorry. I don't know how I snuck up on you, but--
91180 Sounds like some good shit. I'll have to try some myself...
91181 Thomas Ecdycis
91182 What you lookin' at?
91183 We need him alive.
91184 That's a real shame.
91185 What's going on TK? Where'd you get that gas?
91186 He said that if we move he's using us for quick draw practice...
91187 I ain't saying nothing.
91188 Why pay that CURE member to do your dirty work?
91189 Oh. You're deaf.
91190 I don't eff-ing know.
91191 He was just the name they gave me.
91192 They? What are you talking about?
91193 Depending on how experienced you are, you might already know how to make this. I still want you to have it as a thanks.

91197 One last try to make it to the limelight.
91198 Guess again Frankie. You already forgotten.
91199 Frank, I don't want to alarm the women, but standard operating procedure means
91200 there'll be another rescue operation in 24 hours. But if that fails again...
91201 What? What is it?
91202 It's not worth it. He's not going anywhere.
91203 Firebombing. Just like Vegas. Only way to get rid of 'em. For good.
91204 We need to talk.
91205 He knows more - a lot more. 
91206 There's no way he made that gas. He just doesn't have the resources.
91207 The door! It's been breached!
91208 I've gotta hotwire that panel.
91209 Stay here. Barricade the door.
91210 I'm not going anywhere near the slot machines here.

91223 Outbreak shmoutbreak, nothing's going to stop Court and Lauren! Yes!
91224 He's going to tell me. Right now.
91225 AAARRRRGGGHHHH! Get off me you piece of crap! 
91226 Welcome to the club.
91227 AAARRRRGGGHHHH!
91228 Last thing I knew I was sitting by the door, like usual. 
91229 Next thing, I was coming to... looking at you. 
91230 He must have gotten loose somehow.
91231 Can't believe he got the better of me. 
91232 Well, I can tell you right now that isn't going to happen again!
91233 Oh my God, I LOVE this song!
91234 The lights were TOTES worth it.
91235 You got to get me Zombrex, Frankie. And you got to move.
91236 You wanna do some shots? I snagged a bottle of tequila while I was there!
91237 We ought to toss him out there with his own kind. 
91238 Let them tear each other to pieces.
91239 Looks like you got yourself bit pretty bad there, TK.
91240 He's not turning yet. Why?
91241 Perfect! Lets go!
91242 Some people are just more resistant to the infection than others.
91243 I won't make you kill anything, okay?
91244 I'm your story man. You got to help me.
91245 @Okay, well, it'll be a lot easier to manage that while staying alive if you come back with me to the [00CC00FF,Safe House].
91246 So, how long has he got, Frank?
91247 We won't know until he turns.
91250 The only reason we're keeping you alive is because death is way too easy for you.
91251 @Maybe SOME members, but not me! [00CC00FF,I won't attack any infected people]!
91252 You want that interview. It's plain and simple. Something in it for you too, baby.

91258 And you better get used to being a fool. 
91259 By the way, thanks for the meds, sucker.
91260 Don't mess with the face.
91265 Government sources have confirmed that there has indeed 
91266 been a dangerous mutation of the zombie contagion within the city.
91267 Early indications of survivors at the official emergency shelter were proven false 
91268 when a military rescue team entered the shelter only to find it completely overrun
91269 and everyone already dead.
91270 Contact with the rescue team was abruptly lost as they attempted to exit the city. 
91271 They are now presumed to have also perished in the outbreak. 
91272 In light of this new information, the President has ordered 
91273 the immediate eradication of everything within the quarantine zone.
91274 Military bombers are preparing to execute these orders at precisely 7 o'clock. 
91275 Our thoughts go out to the families of all those who have lost loved ones 
91276 in this terrible, terrible, tragedy...
91277 I'm sure there's some somewhere. We've been all over this damn place. We should have started here...

91284 Oh! Please help me! The infected people out there can't help themselves...
91285 Now ease up there, missy.

91304 TK planned to rob the city. But that doesn't explain the rest of it.
91305 First the gas. And now this.
91306 See you guys later.
91307 We know TK framed CURE and started the outbreak, 
91308 but there's no way he could access the media with that lie that we're all dead.
91309 Okay, okay. Stop with the hero talk. I get it.
91310 And he couldn't order a military firebombing.
91311 MY LEGS-- SHIT! SHIIIT!!
91312 This is bigger than TK. WAY bigger. 
91313 Hey, Kaylee. Glad to see you and Liam are getting along well.
91314 Look, I know we've all been through a lot in the past few days, 
91315 but don't go making it worse and start making things up.
91316 Rightful Owner
91317 I sound like a broken record, I know, but one more time. Thanks, Frank.
91318 Where'd that gas come from? Let me see your camera.
91319 I think you're misunderstanding, Frank.
91320 I didn't notice it at the time. Everything was happening so fast.
91321 The gas... it looks like it's coming from underground.
91322 @Frank! Oh my God! You found [00CC00FF,Liam]!
91323 He's one of my friends that I lost at the theme park. I thought he died!
91324 I almost did. If Frank didn't have Zombrex on him, I'd probably be dead by now.
91325 Ok. That's where I go next.
91326 Whoa buddy! Those tunnels are gonna be crawling with thousands of those...
91327 gas zombies or whatever they are. 
91328 Going down there is just plain suicide!
91329 Frank gave you Zombrex? You mean... He actually got your Zombrex back to you?!
91330 He told me what happened to everyone else. It... isn't good. But Liam's here, and that's something. It's a lot, actually.
91331 That was YOUR Zombrex, Liam! I gave it to Frank when we got back here because I thought... well, I thought I'd never see you again.
91332 No, suicide is staying right here.
91333 We all got choices, boy. 
91334 Wait, Frank...
91335 I don't know if you even realized it, Frank, but you actually got that Zombrex back to the guy it was meant for. 
91336 That's a great way to get us all killed! Though I guess that would speed up their work!
91337 Not only did you save me, you saved Kaylee. I hit the jackpot before the outbreak started. I want you to have it, and I'm not taking no for an answer.
91338 @GOAL: Talk to Kaylee \0ADESTINATION: Safe House \0AStacey said that [00CC00FF,Kaylee] has been a lot happier since I brought [00CC00FF,Liam] back. It didn't sound urgent, but I should check in with her when I get a chance.
91339 You know I've just about had it with you and your damned unpatriotic nonsense!
91340 Quite a setup.
91341 None of us are getting out of here until we find out what's really going on. And that gas is our only lead right now.
91342 @GOAL: Help the distraught girl \0ADESTINATION: Uranus Zone \0AStacey mentioned a girl in the scaffolding in [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone]. She looked like she was in trouble, so I should get there quick.
91343 This is going to be good.
91344 It's too dangerous. The story...
91345 It's not about the story anymore Rebecca. We need to find out the truth. 
91346 For all of us. 
91347 Please Frank... be careful. For me...
91348 Ok, let's get this bunch done. We're almost to capacity
91349 and we gotta get these damn bees ready for shipping out.
91350 What the...?
91351 Yeah, things are going just as predicted. 
91352 Absorption of the compound is at 80% of ideal,
91353 and maturation rates are 10 times normal. 
91354 The harvest is going according to -
91355 Who the hell are you? You're not supposed to be in here!
91356 Hey, could I use your phone?
91357 These queens are fully mature. We are exceeding estimates.
91358 You should call the doctor and let him know 
91359 that we're going to start preparing the harvest for shipping.
91360 Phenotrans.
91361 Saw that coming a mile away.
91362 Oh and by the way, your coffee sucks.
91363 Let's get the stragglers.
91364 What the...? That's no zombie! Get him!
91365 Phenotrans. They orchestrated this whole thing.
91366 Should have just let me borrow your phone, boys.
91367 Phenotrans? But they make Zombrex!
91368 @Before we continue, though... Do you have [00CC00FF,Zombrex]? I don't want to turn.
91369 You two just calm down a minute here. 
91370 This one's been feeding us claptrap since you all got here. 
91371 Now look, we're all under a lot of stress, 
91372 seeing things out of the corners of our eyes, imaginary stuff.
91373 I don't know how you did it, but you did. We owe you big time!
91374 Yeah, seriously. Thanks man. You're a hero.
91375 There's nothing imaginary about this.
91376 I don't understand. Why would they...?
91377 Protect the castle with this!
91378 I'll tell you why. It's been a couple of years since the last outbreak.
91379 People aren't buying Zombrex like they used to.
91380 But now zombies are back, and even the military can't stop them.
91381 There are probably line-ups at every pharmacy in the country - all for Zombrex!
91382 They're making a killing off this.
91383 I know you don't want to hear it, but between Willamette and this, you've saved a lot of lives. You're a hero.
91384 See, that's where you're wrong, Frank. I don't see anybody else going out of those vents to bring people back here safe. 
91385 Anybody would have done this, Sarah. Don't be ridiculous.
91386 This is worse than Willamette. They just wanted to drive up their stock.
91387 to drive up their goddamn stock price?
91388 @Frank, you better bring some more [00CC00FF,Zombrex] for [00CC00FF,Sarah]. Sullivan says that he'll do whatever he has to if you don't get back here soon.
91535 Time for a very special guest appearance, Frankie.
91389 I guess I have to live on for my daughter. Thanks, son.
91390 I never want to see a rope again.
91391 Unbelievable. 
91392 We're taking these bastards down. I found this down there too.
91393 I found this down there too.
91394 The world needs more Frank Wests.
91395 I'll call my station. They'll send help.
91396 @I'm one of the co-owners of the [00CC00FF,Atlantica Casino]. Please let me repay you. You didn't have to do any of this.
91397 What the...?!
91398 Thanks for taking care of the idiot protestor and that backstabber TK for me.
91399 I knew I didn't like you.
91400 It's much easier not to have to kill them myself.
91401 Releasing that tape wasn't part of the deal.
91402 But your little comeback proved to be very useful. 
91403 Now allow me to show my appreciation.
91404 Not on my watch!
91405 I'm going to get you some help.
91406 It's too late for me. You... you gotta take care of this. For all of us.
91407 Thanks for saving my ass, Sullivan. You were a good man.
91408 Looks like there's a party going on in Fortune Park.
91409 You bastard. You're on their payroll!
91410 NOTHING will truly show my gratitude, but I might be able to help you out. 
91411 Yup. You were supposed to die in the outbreak, Frank. All of you were supposed to die.
91412 But don't worry - the firebombing will fix all of that. 
91413 So no one will find the bullets in your bodies. 
91414 I didn't want it to go down this way...
91415 Although I have to say I am going to enjoy this...
91416 Come in. I repeat come in. 
91417 I need an update on the harvesting progress immediately.
91418 Oh, well here's your update. It's going just fine, Stacey.
91419 I just destroyed your last harvester. 
91420 And now I'm coming for you.
91421 Come and get me you interfering bastard. I'll be in the theme park.
91422 You can come play on my ride.
91423 I'm locked in!
91424 Go get him Dad!
91425 Don't worry. He's not making it out of here in one piece.
91426 Move in!
91427 Phenotrans, you bastards.
91428 The world has got to see this.
91429 I'll keep looking.
91430 About time you showed up for the after party.
91431 And I am ready to party, you bitch.
91432 For money!
91433 You've nearly ruined the harvest, Frank. 
91434 Do you have any idea how many lives you've destroyed?
91435 Weapons free!
91436 Good. Good one.
91437 What? You and CURE are killing all those people.
91438 You're harvesting human beings, but I'm destroying lives. 
91439 After everything that's happened, you still haven't figured it out, have you Frank?
91440 What kind of reporter are you?
91441 I'm a Phenotrans plant.
91442 And CURE's been a very convenient little tool for us.
91443 They keep starting outbreaks, haven't you noticed?
91444 Eager little activists.
91445 You work for Phenotrans.
91446 So this is all for...what? For money?
91447 You're even more of an idiot than I thought, Frank. This is about saving lives.
91448 Saving lives. You created a panic to drive up demand.
91449 You're missing the point, Frank. We can't make your precious Zombrex without Queens.
91450 A necessary sacrifice for our country.
91451 And, uh, TK looting the city. I suppose that was for our country.
91452 Oh please. He was well paid for giving us access to the cages.
91453 His show was going down the tubes anyways. Which was obvious since you were on it.
91454 Then he decided to get CURE on TV and rob the city. Make it hard for us to finish the job.
91455 So, what? He dragged you into this? So why didn't he give you up?
91456 You think I'm stupid enough to deal with an asshole like that myself?
91457 But enough talk Frank.
91458 I had a feeling you'd show up. So I prepared a little toy for you.
91459 There's a price for everything Frank. And you're about to pay it.
91460 Fortune City was a small price to pay to ensure our country's way of life.
91461 I've wasted enough time here Frank.
91462 See you later Frank! I hope you get some great POV shots of the firebombing!
91463 Acceptable losses. This wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last!
91464 @[00CC00FF,SCOOP: ]Out of Bounds\0A[00CC00FF,BIO: ]A lone survivor separated from her group. Found in Uranus Zone.
91465 Only thanks to you. You pulled me out of a horde of zombies, brought me Zombrex, and saved my life.
91466 You bastard! You did it!
91467 You caused the Vegas outbreak too, didn't you?!
91468 Too bad I don't dig flat chicks.
91469 You killed my wife! Destroyed my family!
91470 I always thought you had a crush on me.
91471 Everything that we have done has been absolutely necessary!
91472 Yeah. I just have an old newspaper that needs to be taken out to the trash.
91475 Bitch had it coming.
91476 Looks like you're a little out of your league, boy.
91477 It's Agent S. I'm ready for extraction.

91479 Someone lied to you.
91480 There's a bunker full of survivors in Fortune City.
91481 and I've got the proof of what happened here. 
91482 I need rescue choppers, and I need them right now.

91497 What about TK?
91498 We have to leave!

91502 I've gotta go get TK. He's got a lot to answer for.
91503 Damn. I hope this helps you, Sarah.
91504 @Frank, can you get back to the Safe House? The unconscious girl [00CC00FF,Sarah] that you brought back is infected. She needs [00CC00FF,Zombrex] if she's going to stand a chance.
91505 Aw, looks like Frankie had other things to do with his busy schedule.
91506 And TK is plum outta patience.
91507 I hope you fry, you zombie prick.
91508 Well, that's our show for tonight.
91509 Stay classy, America.

91513 It's Frank West! 
91514 TK?
91515 Thanks for the Zombrex, Frankie.
91516 You know what? You should have checked out your lady friend's body a bit more carefully.
91517 I sure did.
91518 Famous zombie killer!
91519 Mmmm, mmm. Tasty.
91520 A little prone to losing women though.

91524 She's alive?
91525 Shut up!
91526 If you hurt her...
91527 @I don't have any [00CC00FF,Zombrex].
91528 You ready for some OVERTIME, Frankie? 
91529 She's going to need some medical supplies to stay alive, Frankie boy.

91533 @Frank, you better bring some more [00CC00FF,Zombrex] for [00CC00FF,Jared]. Sullivan says that he'll do whatever he has to if you don't get back here soon.
91535 Time for a very special guest appearance, Frankie.
91536 Better get up, princess. Don't want to waste your last day on earth sleeping.

91560 I DON'T WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS-- AHH! NO!!
91565 No audience participation in this game.
91566 Show's not quite over TK.
91567 Not over? Looks like it is for your girl, though.
91568 Unless you want to try and play doctor.
91570 You gotta be willing...
91571 to risk it all...
91572 if you're ever really gonna...
91573 win...
91574 Fall to your death?
91575 On Wall Street today, Phenotrans shares rose more than 30% after yesterday's release of record quarterly financials. This comes amidst significant questions posed by a special investigative committee regarding their possible involvement in the Fortune City outbreak. And in other news...
91576 You guys wanna hang around here all day, or get outta here?
91577 It's over. We're going home.
91578 Hey Rebecca, you ok to get out of here?
91579 Hey, what do you say you and me go break this story wide open?

91597 Now that makes two of us that have survived two zombie outbreaks, huh, Frankie?
91598 @Hey Frank, come back to the Safe House. [00CC00FF,Kaylee] wants to talk to you. She's in the lounge.
91599 Hmph. Chump Greene... More like... Suck Peen! Hahahaha!!
91600 It's over. We're going home.
91601 None of us even know each other! He rounded us all up... that freaking lasso...
91602 Go! Get out of here!
91603 @GOAL: Investigate High-Noon Shooting Range \0ADESTINATION: Palisades \0AApparently there's a couple in the gun store in the [00CC00FF,Palisades]. Friend or foe?
91604 Can't you just leave it?
91605 It has all of her mother's things in it. 
91606 I'll be right back, it'll only take a second.
91607 Guess who's number one now, Chump Greene...?
91608 Come on! We can't wait any longer!
91609 No! Wait!
91610 Frank!
91611 Close your eyes, baby.
91612 Unable to effectively deal with the Fortune City outbreak, the U.S. Government dispatched a squadron of bombers to level Fortune City, erasing all traces of life, both alive and undead.
91613 A convoy of civilian media choppers managed to rescue the Safe House survivors shortly before the bombing.
91614 Frankie! You made it out of the Arena! It's too bad that the outbreak happened during half-time - we didn't even get to hit the Slicecycles!
91615 'Too bad' isn't exactly how I'd put it, but I'm glad to see you at least made it out. What are you doing in here?
91616 What am I doing?  That's a stupid question. The zombies can't get me here, Frankie. It's safe! The security room is locked, though. I was hoping to find a gun!
91617 Frank West was not among them.
91618 Whether he succumbed to zombies, was killed in the subsequent fire bombing, or somehow managed to escape is unknown.
91619 @It might be safe here, but it's safer at the [00CC00FF,Safe House]. Do you want me to show you how to get there?
91620 @A [00CC00FF,Safe House], huh? Other survivors?
91621 The Fortune City outbreak came in time to be known itself as "Fortune's End".
91622 Despite the controversy, the price of Phenotrans shares continued to rise...
91630 Unable to effectively deal with the Fortune City outbreak, the U.S. Government dispatched a squadron of bombers to level the city, erasing all traces of life, both alive and undead.
91631 @Let me ask you something, Frankie. Is [00CC00FF,Chuck Greene] there?
91632 What? Why do you care if he's there?
91633 Nothing important. He and I have something to discuss, is all.
91634 There is no record of the shelter dwellers having made it out of the city alive. Whether they succumbed to zombie attack or were incinerated in the subsequent firebombing is unknown.
91635 Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but he's not there.
91636 @...[00CC00FF,Chuck Greene] finally bit off more than he could chew, huh? Hah.
91637 As Frank West was unable to assemble and disseminate enough evidence to prove their innocence, CURE was vilified by the media and government alike. The incident came to be known as "Fortune's End".
91638 Hahahaha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! HAAAHAHHA!
91639 Hahaha.
91645 Well, nothing to do now but sit and wait for the rescue.
91646 Stay here.
91647 Ready!
91648 Look, there they are!
91649 What the hell's going on out there?
91650 The attempted rescue of the Fortune City survivors was considered a military failure.
91651 @S-Sorry, sorry! Heheheh. You said there's a [00CC00FF,Safe House], Frankie? Show me.
91652 There is no record of any shelter dwellers having made it out of the city alive. What really happened in Fortune City remains unknown. The incident came to be known as "Fortune's End".
91653 You...
91654 This guy is absolutely crazy...
91660 It's really Frank West.
91661 It really is Frank West.
91662 Hey, sorry to take you by surprise out there. We're supposed to be rounding up survivors.
91663 God, I wish they'd just let me kill you now. 
91664 No way! I'm clicking heads right now!

91670 HELL YEAH!
91671 Why are we stopping? 
91672 @I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a [00CC00FF,Sniper Rifle]. I think [00CC00FF,High-Noon Shooting Range] on the other side of the mall has some.
91673 What the hell?!
91674 The attempted military rescue of the survivors of the Fortune City outbreak was considered a failure. The military was unprepared to deal with what they found. There is no record of any shelter dwellers having made it out of the city alive.
91675 @A [00CC00FF,Safe House]? That sounds pretty darn good right now. 
91676 @And no guns - these old wrists can't handle the kickback. No... A real blade. I want a [00CC00FF,Broadsword].
91677 Frank West was reportedly encountered by the military early in the operation, but no proof of this was ever found. The incident came to be known as "Fortune's End".
91678 You can't expect me to go without a weapon, kid. I need somethin' strong.
91679 There's a few antique shops around this mall. I'm sure you'll be able to find one.
91685 It's not your fault.
91686 We should get ready to go.
91687 What's happening!?
91688 The military rescue mission was unable to find any living survivors of the Fortune City outbreak. The incident came to be known as "Fortune's End".
91689 @I'm not goin' anywhere until I have a proper blade! Get me a [00CC00FF,Broadsword]!
91690 The handle. The metal work. It's incredible...

98067 What in the hell are you doing up here?
98068 I don't exactly remember how I got up here, but I was sleeping off a hangover. That two for one happy hour really did me in!
98069 When I woke up, there was kinda zombies everywhere. They can't seem to get up here, so I figured it was safer to just stay up here.
98070 Whatever, man. If it makes you feel better.
98071 @That hangover probably saved your life. There's a [00CC00FF,Safe House] near here. Come on.
98072 I could use that anyway.

98101 What's the matter? Do you guys need more Zombrex for your research?
98102 ...the movement is growing... soon, we'll all be part of the change...
98103 No, not at all. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
98104 I would have said something sooner, but Jessup is intimidating. I needed to wait until I was alone.
98105 Hey, you uh... you all right?
98106 What's wrong, Marshall? Is Jessup threatening you?
98107 It wasn't supposed to go down like that...
98108 We're not making a cure. Jessup lied to you and I helped him.
98109 But now, I see how radical it is. Now, my life has meaning again.

98120 @Hey Frank, that pharmacist you brought back, [00CC00FF,Marshall], wants to speak with you. He said it's really urgent.

98137 Elizabeta Ortiz
98138 No... what have I done?
98139 No...
98150 Please, we just needed food!
98151 Hell, we're not even pharmacists. I'm a pizza delivery guy.
98152 Yeah, that's it! Now let me hear you beg, boy.
98153 Is someone there?
98154 Hello? I heard the door.
98155 Hey, I'm here.
98156 I knew it! Is something going on? I heard the sirens and suddenly I was alone in here.
98157 Wha? Who are you?! Another trespasser? 
98158 I'm in charge of this here mall! You can't just come waltzing in here! 
98159 You think I'm just gonna roll over and play dead? Not anymore!! 
98160 You ain't the big man in town. Not no more. 
98161 Everybody else is dead! I'M THE BIG MAN NOW!!
98162 Nothing's happened to me yet, so I figured I'm safe in here, whatever's going on.
98165 Whoa, big man. Not here to argue.
98166 Hey, what's going on here?
98167 Oh, think you're better than me? Well, you ain't got the badge, do you?
98168 If you don't mind me asking, are you blind?
98169 What gave it away? The glasses, the stick, or me not knowing someone was there until you walked through the door?
98170 Now YOU fellas have to listen to ME! Y'all can't push me around now. 
98171 Oh, no. Not now. If I say dance...
98172 The honest answer to that question is the fact you haven't noticed the entire city is filled with zombies.
98173 Are you serious?!
98174 @I'm afraid so. There's a [00CC00FF,Safe House] nearby with some other survivors. I can take you there through the vents since the door is sealed now.
98175 You DANCE!
98176 Sounds like a plan. I'll need you to lead me there. I don't imagine my own pace is enough to outrun them without tripping.
98177 Sooooeeeeee! Piggy piggy piggy!
98178 I'm the big shot now... 
98179 I'm twice the man you are...
98180 Well, shoulda saw that coming.
98181 SANDBOX MODE
98200 Ah, come in, come in! Finally.
98201 I am Antoine. They call me the king of cuisine!
98202 I have been expecting you.
98203 Well you're, uh, you're a bit late, but it's good you finally made it.
98204 It's true what they say... tastes like chicken.
98205 WAIT!
98206 Needs a bit more buttah.
98207 Thank you for leading me back. I would have been dead in hours if it wasn't for you.
98208 What?
98209 Dude! Are you, like, security?
98210 I've been like, locked in here for DAYS, bro. Not cool.
98211 You guys, like, totally stole my board. Not my fault you guys have some sick places to skate. I HAD to get it back, bro.
98212 The door was open when I came in. It must have, like, locked behind me or something, bro...
98213 You've been in here for days?
98214 Pfft. I mean like... yeah, but it wasn't all bad. There's lots of food, and I used that corner over there-
98215 I don't need to hear anymore.
98216 ZOMBIE OUTBREAK?!
98217 If you've been in here for days... Do you know about the zombie outbreak?
98218 What, you don't like buttah?? 
98219 This is for you! I have created my, my ultimate dish!
98220 Daring! Original! Exotic! And fresh... oh yes... VERY fresh. 
98221 You and your readers will find it easily worthy of 4 stars!
98222 What?!
98223 WHAT DO YOU MEAN "ZOMBIE OUTBREAK", BRO?!
98224 Calm down! I mean what I said. The zombies from the Arena got loose. The whole city is infested with them. Go look if you don't believe me.
98225 There's other survivors in a safe place, waiting for the military to come pick us all up. Do you want me to take you there?
98230 I think you have me confused with someone else.
98231 @Hoooooooooly hell man. Alright, I'll come with you, bro. But like, I don't wanna damage the board, so [00CC00FF,I'm not gonna be killing any zombies].
98232 You... you're not the reviewer? But I have been WAITING FOR YOU!
98233 You're off your freakin' rocker if you think I'm givin' up my board, bro.
98234 Are you serious? What, do you want to hold hands the whole way there, too?
98235 A skater boy looking for his board. Found in the Uranus Zone Security Room.
98236 No offense, but I really don't want to eat that.
98237 Sounds good to me, man. Nothing wrong with a little bro on bro hand holding.
98238 HOW DARE YOU!? I AM ANTOINE! I AM THE KING OF CUISINE!!
98239 Carlos
98240 @Something's going on. I saw the door in the [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone Security Room] banging like somebody's trying to break it down from the inside.
98241 No matter. No matter! This can still be a once in a lifetime meal.
98242 So sit... relax... Antoine will make you... DINNER!
98243 Shut In
98244 @GOAL: Get in the security room \0ADESTINATION: Uranus Zone \0AStacey said thought she saw someone in the [00CC00FF,Security Room] in [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone].
98250 Oh! I've kept you waiting for so long. 
98251 I know you want that encore, right? 
98252 Oooh, yeah, baby! 
98253 This is going to be incredible!
98254 You know I do it all for you, people!.
98255 That was just a sound check, but I know you loved it, right?
98256 RIGHT!?
98257 I know can you barely even wait for this comeback tour to start. 
98258 Oh, I can feel that! 
98259 I can feel your energy!
98260 Bro, me and you should totally hit the park sometime. Use this to practice up.
98261 Carlos Mertiz
98262 Hell, I can barely stand keeping myself from you. 
98263 But we are gonna need a few more things before we can start...
98264 and if I don't get them soon...
98265 @Frank, can you head back to the [00CC00FF,Safe House]? [00CC00FF,Sven] is running out of supplies and he needs you to get him some things.
98266 This stick is basically my eyes. I need to keep it.
98267 No thanks! I'd rather keep my pony.
98268 How am I supposed to work under these conditions?
98269 I am an artist!
98270 Well, despite the technical problems caused by my incompetent crew,
98271 the show must go on!
98272  @SKATEBOARD TRICKS: Skateboards have 3x durability and you can perform basic tricks on them.
98273 Everybody follow this guy! He's going to get us somewhere safe!
98274 NO!
98275 We're... we're wired. If we move, they'll go off.
98276 She's coming.
98277 I'd get her what she needs, bro.
98278 Hey, you! Ooh! You the new crew? 
98279 Or maybe just another crazy fan who loves me to death? 
98280 Good, I got a job for you baby, oh yeah! 
98281 I need you to run a few errands for me, kiddo. 
98282 Before we get started. 
98283 I'm not sure if I can take waiting anymore. 
98284 I get explosive when I have to wait.
98285 Well, we can't keep my audience waiting! 
98286 Well, you've been a good little assistant, cutie-pie. 
98287 And now... it's finally time for my big comeback show. 
98288 The performance of a lifetime! 
98289 I'll need some help backstage.
98290 This zombie outbreak made me realize I'm growing up too fast. I gotta make the good times last.
98291 My naive friends might trust you, but I don't. There's no trust here.
98292 Help backstage? 
98293 You mean we're not done now?
98294 Who are you?
98295 Ouch.
98296 Oh, surely you're not suggesting that after all this, 
98297 I don't give my adoring audience what they want? 
98298 The comeback tour everyone's waiting for? 
98299 The big number? 
98300 I might get a little angry if that happens.
98301 You want me to just come with you? Blindly trust a stranger in the middle of a zombie outbreak?
98302 Do you want to stay and get eaten alive instead?
98305 Yo man, just do it!
98306 Look, listen lady...
98307 Oh, shush. 
98308 Now get backstage and let's put on this show. 
98309 You can't keep talent like mine waiting. 
98310 That... thing will give you instructions.
98311 Are you guys okay?
98312 Caitlin tripped and hurt her ankle, but otherwise, yeah.
98315 Prepare yourself... for genius.
98316 What are you guys doing out here? It's way too dangerous to be running around the food court.
98317 Oh, you're the best stage manager I ever had, kiddo...
98318 and you've got a nice little butt on you to boot.
98319 I just got this new job! I started at the mall today!
98320 @Listen, man. I'm from Canada. I don't know my way around this place. We were trying to get to the [00CC00FF,Emergency Shelter], but it's closed.
98321 The shelter's not opening at this point. Doors sealed shut - you're not getting in that way. I know a way in there through the vents.
98322 Oh, yeah, baby! Oh, you love it!
98323 And you love ME! You really, really love me!!
98324 Really? Do you think you could help us get there? We're struggling to move with Caitlin hurt.
98325 It's not too far from here. Come on.
98326 Alright. Talk to Nikki before you go - she can be a little stubborn with strangers, and Jonesy won't go anywhere without her.
98327 Oh, And who can blame you?!
98328 Maybe this outbreak isn't all bad. I don't have to tell my mom I got fired... I can tell her the zombies ate my boss!
98329 You had your chance to work with the entertainer of the new millennium! 
98330 But your own selfish needs destroyed my comeback!
98331 That was once in a lifetime opportunity, people! 
98332 And you blew it.
98333 Oh, lord, down I go.
98334 Jonesy
98335 Jonesy Garcia
98336 And I do mean that literally.
98337 I started writing poetry. What do you think?
98350 Hey, you!
98351 Aw, shit
98352 Weird...
98353 Look what I found you, pretty girl.
98354 You think you're tough?! You can't even wake up! None of you were there for me! You suck!
98355 Fresh meat!
98356 Snowflake hungry.
98357 @Oh my God, Frank! There's [00CC00FF,6teens] in the [00CC00FF,Food Court]! One of them is hurt! Help them, quickly!
98358 Hey, uh, there are lots of zombies around here.
98359 Maybe she could eat those.
98360 @GOAL: Start to find your way to the 6 teens \0ADESTINATION: Food Court \0AStacey saw a bunch of people in one of the restaurants at the [00CC00FF,Food Court]. They looked young.
98361 No! No! Not zombies! That meat is rotten! Like all her food now. 
98362 It went bad. She needs meat. Fresh meat.
98363 Caitlin
98364 Caitlin Cooke
98365 Here. You're own your own for the first time, since meeting up. This could be useful.
98366 Sure, sure, I can get some fresh meat. Steak!
98367 Maybe I'll go look for some.
98368 We're only 16! We were just starting to find our way...
98369 Jen
98370 Jen Masterson
98371 Here. You look like you'll need this a lot more than us now.
98372 NO!
98373 People not been very good to me. 
98374 Not like Snowflake.
98375 Snowflake my friend.
98376 Whoa, listen, let's talk this over. What's your name?
98377 Jude
98378 Jude Lizowski
98379 Theodore... but everyone call me Ted.
98380 Gotta Make The Good Times Last
98381 Ted, huh? That's a nice name.
98382 We just need to slow down and talk this over, Ted.
98383 Nice and slow.
98384 @[00CC00FF,SCOOP: ]Gotta Make The Good Times Last\0A[00CC00FF,BIO: ]Lost his job at Stick-It after health concerns shut them down. Part of a group of 6teens. Found in the Food Court.
98385 Nikki Wong
98386 NO!!! Ted not slow! 
98387 They all said that! 
98388 Ted not slow! 
98389 Stop saying that!! 
98390 Nikki
98391 Oh Shit...
98392 See, people not nice!
98393 Snowflake... go and eat your fresh meat... nice and slow...
98394 Direct Deposit
98395 @GOAL: Investigate the panicked looter \0ADESTINATION: Uranus Zone \0AApparently there's a looter losing his cool in the bank at [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone]. Maybe I should check it out.
98396 Ted no feel so good... 
98397 Snowflake! Kitty! 
98398 Come, kitty! 
98399 Are you still hungry, girl?
98400 Take me, Snowflake! 
98401 Ted feed you! Ted take care of you... 
98402 Fresh meat... just for you, kitty...
98403 Really, man?
98404 Just... Okay, fine! Give me 
98405 Kitty... kitty... time for supper...
98406 Whoa.
98407 Good kitty.
98450 Randall my son, I... I think you should reconsider...
98451 ...Wait, you actually gave it to me? I... didn't really expect that.
98452 @[00CC00FF,SCOOP: ]Direct Deposit\0A[00CC00FF,BIO: ]Wannabe looter that doesn't fit in. Found in Uranus Zone.
98453 RANDY... Father... call me Randy... 
98454 GET ON WITH IT!!
98455 H-H-Hey! G-Get out of here or I'm g-gonna tase you!
98456 Jeez, kid. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you, and I feel like you're not going to hurt me.
98457 O-Oh yeah? Well, g-give me all your money!!!
98458 Do you... Randy... take this woman to be your...
98459 Are you for real, man? We're in the middle of an outbreak and you're going to mug me?
98460 @Y-Yeah! I am! [00CC00FF,$1000] or so sounds good!
98461 Mmmmm... I do... Father... I do... Ooooh...
98462 Shayne
98463 Shayne Giarratana
98464 @Y-You heard me! [00CC00FF,$1000]! Hand it over!
98465 Uhhhh... what now?
98466 Don't worry honey...
98467 ...the other ones didn't mean anything to me... 
98468 ... just remember to say "I do".
98469 @This is just sad. Why don't you come back to the [00CC00FF,Emergency Shelter] with me? It's a lot safer there than it is out here, and the military's coming to pick us up.
98470 You wanted me to wait until I was married... well, I'm not waiting anymore.
98471 Oh, I knew I wouldn't die a virgin!! 
98472 Oh, I can't WAIT... I can't WAIT... I can't WAIT... 
98473 Cut to the end Dad... Cut to the end...
98474 CUT TO THE END!
98475 @Frank, I'm seeing something weird. There's one of those looters in the bank at [00CC00FF,Uranus Zone]. He looks more scared than angry. Maybe check it out?
98476 I'm not cut out for this looting stuff. I think I'll just wait for the military...
98477 At least there's no crazy convicts chasing us through the park this time. Let's go.
98480 If anyone knows of any reason why these two should not be joined in union, 
98481 speak now, or forever hold your...
98482 At least there's no crazy convicts chasing us through the park this time.
98483 Well, the military's coming to get us in a couple of hours, and I wouldn't want to risk being here any longer than necessary.
98484 I'll come check the place out. You're not convincing me to stay this time if I want to leave, though.
98485 Oh I can't wait baby... I'm gonna CONSUMATE you... 'till you SCREAM! HAHAHAHA
98486 You mean there's a way out of here?! Other people?! Why didn't you say that from the start?! Take me there! Please!! I'm begging you!!!
98487 He's coming to pick me up three days from now. Sound familiar?
98488 I guess I can stay there until tomorrow. I could use somwhere to rest anyway.
98489 This is what we've been using to get into the ATMs. You deserve to know since you saved my ass.
98490 Oh thank God! Help us! Help us!
98491 Would have been nice to have something like this in Willamette, don't you think?
98492 That being said, you did get me to him. Damn. You're quite the smooth talker, Frank West.
98493 You! You're trying to ruin... the happiest day of our lives!
98494 Good for it?! We might have flown out of there, Frank, but it wasn't because of your helicopter. Otis saved our asses.
98495 Come with me until then. I was good for it last time, remember?
98496 What a coincidence.
98497 Baby... We could have been so good together... 
98498 Our wedding night would have been so...
98499 @Hey Frank, if you go to the [00CC00FF,Yucatan Casino], watch out! It looks like there's a tiger running loose in there.
98500 You may now feed the bride.
98550 You get the hell away from my bike.
98551 Whoa, chill, ok? Sorry, didn't know it was yours.
98552 It's a nice bike though.
98553 Hey, sorry buddy, I thought you were one of those crazies.
98554 You can't trust people anymore. I've been dealing with nutbars all day long.
98555 These zombies... they're annoying, sure, but they're easy to kill.
98556 You know, kinda... kinda fun, even.
98557 The real threat is the people. 
98558 An outbreak like this does things to men. The violence. The death.
98559 Seeing loved ones die... change...
98560 It makes people snap. Just like that.
98561 People just like you and me.
98562 Just when humanity should be coming together, they turn on each other instead.
98563 I've got a daughter to protect. I won't let anything get in my way.
98564 Your daughter? Well, listen, I can take you both back to the Safe House.
98565 Katey needs her Zombrex every 24 hours.
98566 Right baby?
98567 Oh, your daughter.
98568 Do you know what would happen if she didn't get her Zombrex every day?
98569 But I would never let that happen. 
98570 We still have some time, Katey. I'll find some if it kills me.
98571 Look, let's get you and your... daughter... back to the Safe House so that...
98572 Get the hell away from her.
98573 Oh, crap.
98574 You're just one of those nutbars!
98575 You just want to hurt her!
98576 Keep her from getting her Zombrex!
98577 Nobody messes with my kid.
98578 Hey!
98580 You're crazy! This isn't a game!
98581 He's flying in three days from now, on the roof of the Yucatan Casino. Sound familiar?
98582 You're right about that... that was just practice.
98583 Now it's a game! Terror is Reality, baby, for real! 
98584 I've always wanted to take you down, chump. 
98585 But you need some wheels, Frankie.
98586 Live in Fortune City! 
98587 Man, that guy was a few screws short of a workbench.
98588 Ok, this place is nuts.
98590 Don't keep me waiting.
98591 Katey... Katey...
98592 Are you all right?
98593 Katey, you're ok. You're safe now.
98594 That's all that matters... that's all that matters.
98595 I can't imagine what I would do if anything ever happened to you.
98596 That guy seemed like he had real potential.
98597 Katey?
98598 On top... all the way to the end...
98599 I'm onto you, Frank! First you take me away from my money, and then I find you have the leader of CURE here?! They started this whole outbreak!
98600 I don't want to hear your excuses, Frank. Either she goes or we go. We're not safe with her here.
98601 Do you really expect me to believe that?
98602 I think it's better than the alternative.
98603 But never forget, chump. I'm number one!
98604 You asked a handful of people if you should send a girl to her death?
98605 Listen to me, Stuart. You know what's going to happen if you send her out there. Do you really want to risk it without being a hundred percent sure?
98606 Well, I don't need your help this time, Frank. I had a helicopter tour around Fortune City. The pilot's my buddy.
98607 Yeah, you're on fire.
98608 Something like that.
98650 Damn, man. It ain't no fun if they ain't running.
98651 I mean, I mean, where's the challenge? 
98652 This ain't nearly as fun as border patrol.
98653 You're telling me you're out here playing hero again?
98654 @Listen, I'd love to play catch up as much as the next guy, but it isn't safe here. I can bring you to the [00CC00FF,Emergency Shelter]. There's other survivors there.
98655 But we got a chance to be real patriots here, Earl. 
98656 And get us some target practice! These so-called survivors, ha! 
98657 Bunch of whiners let this thing happen. 
98658 Letting zombies in, foreigners in, letting socialism in.
98659 In the uneaten flesh. I thought I was the only one unlucky enough to be caught in both of these outbreaks.
98660 Wait a minute... Kindell?!
98661 Frank, Stuart and a few others just left the Safe House. I heard them say something about making me pay for the outbreak. Be careful out there.
98662 Only way to git this country on track agin is clean it right up 
98663 of all those pansies, floozies, bur-o-crats, liberals, 
98664 and them half-ass conservatives too. 
98665 This is a golden opportunity.
98666 @Hey Frank, I need your help! That casino worker [00CC00FF,Stuart] is convincing people to throw me out. He thinks I started the outbreak!
98667 Fan?! I covered your ass while you carried that Isabela girl back in Willamette, and you don't even remember me?
98668 Damn straight. We's infested in more ways that one. 
98669 If you ain't with us, you're against us. 
98670 We gotta clean this country up, one city at a time.
98671 Yeah, you're not the first fan to tell me that.
98672 That's as Amerikin as apple pie, that is.
98673 You know what we have to do, Earl?
98674 It's our duty to eliminate the threat to our country. 
98675 Clean this place out completely. Start again, like the great deluge. 
98676 Right idea, that.
98677 It is! Frank West! You really can't keep your nose out of a zombie outbreak, huh?
98678 Is that who I think it is?
98679 That's right. We do it cuz we love our country...
98680 So this is your hideout this time, huh? I guess I could stick around...
98681 ... and cuz it's so much damn fun.
98682 Damn, it feels good to be right!
98683 Whoo hoo! Let's go huntin' boys!
98684 God bless America!
98685 You're such a kind man to bring me a safe place. Can I get your phone number? So that I can pay you back.
98700 Jessup, wait. That's Frank West. He's that guy with the book. The reporter from the Willamette Incident, remember?
98701 A polite average woman. Held hostage with Denyce and Drake by the looters.
98702 A cool altitude looking university student. Aims to be the best photographer. Held hostage with Denyce and Alice by the looters.
98703 Should I have taken a photo with the looters to get the best project!
98704 Abracadabra!
98705 DAMMIT!!
98706 Roger, you idiot!
98707 placeholder
98708 We need to get on the ball if I'm ever going to get out of this hole
98709 and into the spot light as I deserve!

98789 Then, I let things get to me.
